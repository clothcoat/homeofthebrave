### Parties ###
TEX_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
TEX_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America -  The SPA operating in our territory is loyal to the IWW in the CSA, and our relations with them are largely dictated by our relations with them. Nonetheless, machine politics, propaganda and the use of populism to absorb many of their potential voters has left them without a chance of being elected in our region."
TEX_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
TEX_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - The SPA operating in our territory is loyal to the IWW in the CSA, and our relations with them are largely dictated by our relations with them. Nonetheless, machine politics, propaganda and the use of populism to absorb many of their potential voters has left them without a chance of being elected in our region."
TEX_radical_socialist_party:0 "Independent League"
TEX_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Independent League - An association aligned with the Social Patriots in the CSA, these radicals are aligned with radical farm groups and seek a class collaborative form of socialism."
TEX_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
TEX_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party - Most of the former progressive Republicans have ended up in the Progressive Party which ran before the Civil War. Without a national organ to draw from, the National Progressives are gradually absorbing them and making them a sub-wing of their organization."
TEX_social_liberal_party:0 "National Progressive Party"
TEX_social_liberal_party_long:0 "National Progressive Party - Part of the Republican Party has collapsed into the National Progressive Party, a creation of the Wisconsin-based La Follete family and one of the few major challengers to Long's agenda, with the party claiming to be more progressive than populist."
TEX_market_liberal_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The liberal democrats in the region desire a reunion with the pro-democratic factions of America at once if possible, only agreeing to work with the AUS to stop more radical factions. That said they do pay more lip service to farmers relative to other wings of the liberal democrats throughout the nation."
TEX_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party in the region that operates legally have often had to made concessions to populist rhetoric but in practice largely work with the AUS out of fear of the Old Democrats, non-local big business and Socialists. Supportive of segregation, their support would likely wane if lip service was paid to race progressives."
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The America First Party is a populist-American broad tent made up of those who follow a laborist, patriotic ideology and also generally view left socialism as being unpatriotic or totalitarian. They stand in opposition to other progressives by their reliance on political machines, their Share the Wealth Plan, relative cultural conservatism, populist-messaging, party militias and, more than anything, their personalism based around Louisiana Governor and firebrand Huey Long. As such they preach an odd mixture of radicalism, populism and pragmatism in order to enact a pro-labor and pro-famer capitalist nation united around the American identity."
TEX_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The Radicals of the AFP view traditional voting as inadequate to the American people due to the influence of large corporations and banks, and believe a presidential dictatorship enveloped in populism would better represent the will of the American people."
TEX_national_populist_party:0 "White Leagues"
TEX_national_populist_party_long:0 "White Leagues - The various White Leagues in our territory are unorganized paramilitary organizations cut off the central apparatus of the National Democratic White League. While some have chosen not to take an official side during the war, the vast majority have sympathies with the CAR. Some AUS activists believe we could appeal to them to stop them from actively attacking us while other would see them finished."

TEX_liberal_AFP_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The Radicals of the AFP view traditional voting as inadequate to the American people due to the influence of large corporations and banks, and believe a presidential dictatorship enveloped in populism would better represent the will of the American people."
TEX_progressive_AFP_social_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_progressive_AFP_social_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is progressive-populism which defends and even seeks to enact further welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race moderation or progressivism in favor of strong civic nationalism."
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_liberal_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_liberal_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is liberal populism which defends and even seeks to enact further welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race moderation in favor of strong civic nationalism."
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_conservative_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_conservative_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is conservative populism which defends welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race conservatism."

TEX_christian_party:0 "Christian Party"
TEX_christian_party_long:0 "Christian Party - The official political-wing of the Silver Legion of America and a creation of William Dudley Pelley, the CP has largely absorbed both conservative populists and former democrats in the religious nationalist party. United by populist proposals of patriotism, universal employment and a minimum income for full citizens, the CP differs from the AFP and NPP in the emphasis on its military wing, Pelley's writings, harsher attitude towards socialism, citizen referendums, more explicitly Christian-based welfare, stricter constitutionalism, cultural supremacism (including overt anti-Semitism), and Pelley's ward policy towards groups of people he views as unproductive. As such the group is unsurprisingly extremely divisive even with the populist AUS, not helped by its even more radical-wing of the party being even more overtly racialist as well openly authoritarian, with many unsure how far Pelley would go to appease them."
TEX_christian_party_auth:0 "Christian Party"
TEX_christian_party_auth_long:0 "Christian Party - The official political-wing of the Silver Legion of America and a creation of William Dudley Pelley, the CP has largely absorbed both conservative populists and former democrats in the religious nationalist party.

TEX_texan_democrat_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_texan_democrat_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party, now a revitalized force under the leadership of Pappy O'Daniel, stands poised to rebuild the country from the ruins of war and economic depression alike. Texas has taken its rightful place as the leading American state, and its culture and values will surely have as profound of an impact on American culture as the Hillbilly Boys have in recent years. Though O'Daniel has his work set out for him, it seems that every American has heard the phrase "pass the biscuits, Pappy", a testament to his charisma and popularity. With the people behind him, O'Daniel will bring his vision to America."

TEX_lighning_joe_idea_4_desc:0 "If our artillery can be coordinated with other areas of our army, and with each other, we can have a much more effective means of bombarding our enemy. We should work to ensure that this is the case, for our explosive power may just win us this war."

TEX_silver_legion_support:0 "Use Silver Legion Support"
TEX_silver_legion_support_desc:0 "The Silver Legion has developed a considerable following, with supporters well-placed within the AUS military and public sector.

### Huey Long Path ###
TEX_new_washington:0 "The New Washington"
TEX_new_washington_desc:0 "Huey Long has done it! Populists, who have been sneered at or even ignored since their birth in Kansas, now reign supreme in the country. It is thanks to our new Washington, Huey Long, that this could be achieved. With Long at the helm, nothing is beyond our reach. We shall overcome poverty and make America the nation it was always meant to be. Every man a king!"
TEX_to_the_victor:0 "To the Victor"
TEX_to_the_victor_desc:0 "It is over. The enemies of the American People have been felled and we control their lands. It is time to take possession of the enemies military assets, placing the AFP in charge of these valuable resources. Our control over the states will set the groundwork for the political future of America."
TEX_root_out_out_traitors:0 "Root out Traitors"
TEX_root_out_out_traitors_desc:0 "Despite their armies being defeated, extremists still populate the American states we have brought justice to. We need to root out those whom will never be satisfied with democracy under Huey Long, namely the militant cells that threaten the American populace at every turn."
TEX_reconcile_the_left:0 "Reconcile the Left"
TEX_reconcile_the_left_desc:0 "We can never excuse the CSA's attempt to overthrow the American Constitution or their embrace of anti-American syndicalism, but the grievances of the workers that were fooled into supporting them are fair. We should appeal to the Independent Leagues and AFL, whom desire economic reform. We know they wanted to work with Huey even before the war, but the most extreme radicals made a ceasefire the best offer we could provide. We will now bleed support from these same radicals."
TEX_afp_alone:0 "AFP Alone"
TEX_afp_alone_desc:0 "Compromise. That was the word used by useless politicians who nearly handed our country over to extremists. The AFP and the nation more generally is not going to go out of its way to appeal to any of the factions that aligned themselves against the American Union State. If they so wish, let them repent and embrace Longist values on their own, but we will not compromise."
TEX_reconcile_the_right:0 "Reconcile the Right"
TEX_reconcile_the_right_desc:0 "There is no mistake that the political right made mistakes in supporting either the Feds or Murray. However their pro-American values and defense of capitalism against syndicalism is admirable. Besides, their machines are too large to hit head on. Instead, we should co-opt them with appeals to the cultural conservativism and anti-socialist populism, opening the way to taking the South."
TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats:0 "Dismantle the Dixiecrats"
TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats_desc:0 "The right-wing Democrats have looked down on Huey Long since he was a lawyer defending the little man from corporations. Now they wish for us to allow their machines to thrive, despite their attempts on the Kingfish's life. Let's see if they are so smug when the radical DWL gets a taste of their own medicine and the regressive Southern machine is wholly replaced by a progressive one."
TEX_black_support:0 "Black Support"
TEX_black_support_desc:0 "With our desire to displace the Old Democrats in their entirety, we have gained a more positive reputation with the country's black population. While Huey has long been ambigious on Civil Rights issues, he has suddenly found himself more vocally supporting increased spending on black communities at the expense of the landed elites of the South, leading to a rapid increase in black AFP supporters."
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie:0 "Shake Hands with Dixie"
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie_desc:0 "The Old Democrats are finished on a national scale, but their machine in the South remains. The Union made a terrible and costly mistake in bothering to oppose it after the Civil War, one we should not repeat. While we will hunt down the irreconciable White Leagers, we should cut a deal with the Southern Democrats whom now look to us for protection, promising not to uproot them so long as they do not oppose Long."
TEX_a_new_solid_south:0 "A New Solid South"
TEX_a_new_solid_south_desc:0 "The Southern Democratic machine lost the war and as a result learned its place under Long. They are already making appeals to support him on the national level if allowed to maintain their machines in the South and given some autonomy. So long as they weed out radical anti-Longists and pay their share, there is no need to further disrupt the South. They are now a reliable voting block and White League opposition is winding down."
TEX_expand_the_minute_men:0 "Expand the Minutemen"
TEX_expand_the_minute_men_desc:0 "In order to preserve the integrity of our armed forces, we must expand the Minutemen into the field of civil protection and border monitoring. The insurgent socialists, White Leaguers, and MacArthurites don't adhere to the rules of engagement anymore. Therefore we must prepare for any level of brutality on their part."
TEX_election_monitoring:0 "Election Monitoring"
TEX_election_monitoring_desc:0 "The only force that can ensure the democratic process is carried out is the Minutemen, who shall be deployed every November to safeguard voting areas from harm. They shall keep an eye to safeguard the voting process for our third-party allies and make sure nothing goes wrong for us."
TEX_destroy_the_klan:0 "Destroy the Klan"
TEX_destroy_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans and his cadre of his Grand Wizards have finally been arrested and brought to trial for their terroristic actions. Murders, lynchings, and voter intimidation are being brought against this most dangerous group of traitors. With their conviction, we have finally pacified the most extreme faction seeking to destroy the American First Party."
TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Members of Congress have devised a way to establish a baseline of trust in our democratic system, which is sorely needed. The so-named Fish Act would require every party representative, labor union leader and public servant to sign an affidavit stating that they will never aid the CSA or MacArthur junta."
TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyalty"
TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The Fish Act's critics rightfully stated that there was no incentive for officials to sign the affidavits. In response, a second Act is passed to provide compensation for the time spent in the public service during the Civil War that was postponed by the Federalists. This back-pay would require signing the aforementioned affidavit, of course."
TEX_the_american_progress:0 "The American Progress"
TEX_the_american_progress_desc:0 "The AFP newspaper has always been the The American Progress and there is no reason to stop that now. The American Progress will be expanded at once to spread the word. Endorsed by the President, it will explode in popularity and become the newspaper of record for our nation, replacing the New York Times."
TEX_veteran_benefits:0 "Veteran Benefits"
TEX_veteran_benefits_desc: "We will need to stay in the good graces of veterans who fought for the American Union State, maintaining their loyalty to the state in the process. We should increase veteran benefits via direct welfare and have the AFP open veteran auxillaries."
TEX_national_political_machine:0 "National Political Machine"
TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "Executive orders have been used to create agencies to serve the American people in the past, so long as it does not intrude into state sovereignty. In the past, this power has led to corruption from corporate interests. The president is, however, incorruptible. Turning the tables against the monopolies and grafters is his promise to America."
TEX_new_democracy:0 "New Democracy"
TEX_new_democracy_desc:0 "New Democracy is a new social contract between the American people and leadership. New Democracy promises a politician that will work in his constituents’ interests through adversity, even through violence. Loyalty to your constituents will be rewarded until every man is a king."
TEX_peoples_commission:0 "People's Commission"
TEX_peoples_commission_desc:0 "Inspired by the judicial districts of Louisiana, the president has created a para-legal representative entity called the Peoples Commission. The Peoples Commission is a nonpartisan forum for public discussion that will allow the AFP to directly communicate with the American people and hear issues that politicians will not report on."
TEX_every_man_a_king:0 "Every Man a King"
TEX_every_man_a_king_desc:0 "What began as a dream and was then lifted from a motivational book by Orison Swett Mardin, Every Man a King is now a political reality. With our tax rates and public control of valuable utilities every family can be guaranteed to recieve a minimum guaranteed living income, finally ending poverty in the United States."
TEX_for_the_poor_man:0 "For the Poor Man"
TEX_for_the_poor_man_desc:0 "Now the president has brought to Congress legislation to furnish a homestead allowance of 1/3rd the average wealth. A guaranteed annual income of $2000 and old-age pensions is ready to be distributed to loyal Americans. Until such a time as the proper income tax changes are made, these benefits are coming out of the National Treasury."
TEX_populist_education:0 "Education for the Masses"
TEX_populist_education_desc:0 "Across this great nation, there are millions more children struggling to resume normal life. However, they face a future no better than that of their parents without education. President Long has approved the bill Congress sped through to rebuild schools and reopen colleges for Americans in need."
TEX_wealth_ceiling:0 "Wealth Ceiling"
TEX_wealth_ceiling_desc:0 "Tycoons of industry have robbed our people for too long. In light of this, we have decided to implement a new wealth cap. This will allow for a fairer distribution of wealth, and it may even help our small businesses thrive. This will make the wealthy angry, but we welcome their hate." 
TEX_road_map_for_the_future:0 "Roadmap for the Future"
TEX_road_map_for_the_future_desc:0 "The expenses the president has taken out for Every Man a King will require a fundamentally different means of tax collection and public financing to sustain itself. Therefore, President Long has laid out a road-map to plan out spending for the next four years of his term and milestones that America should cross."
TEX_townsend_plan:0 "Townsend Plan"
TEX_townsend_plan_desc:0 "Francis Townsend's plan for ending old age poverty via a generous pension scheme has long been part of Long's platform and will now be enacted. A National Sales Tax will help fund the gift of 200 dollars to every retired person over 60, which they must spend within a month to stimulate the economy."
TEX_founders_legacy:0 "Legacy of Founders and Scripture"
TEX_founders_legacy_desc:0 "When our founders declared independence, it was from British Royalty, but now it is economic royalty we must battle. Vacation days for workers and nationalized railroads will empower the people while combating the economic barons."
TEX_national_youth_adminstration:0 "National Youth Administration"
TEX_national_youth_adminstration_desc:0 "The orphans of the Civil War need not only education to uplift themselves, but discipline as well. A visit to Boys Town near Omaha, Nebraska has inspired President Long to create the National Youth Administration. A work training and activism group for young Americans, which gives orphans a place to stay and trains them in important life skills, will be created."
TEX_share_the_wealth:0 "Share the Wealth"
TEX_share_the_wealth_desc:0 "It has come time for the rich that helped plunge America into civil war to pay. No person will be allowed to accumulate more than 300 times the annual national income. Incomes are capped at $1 million, and inheritances capped at $5.1 million. President Long will prove the newspapers who decried him wrong."
TEX_imperial_presidency:0 "Imperial Presidency"
TEX_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "With traitors uprooted and exposed, public opinion polls now show overwhelming support for President Long's re-election. Unrestrained by pressure to conform or be threatened by members within the AFP, the president has begun what many are calling his 'imperial presidency'. The two-term limit is respectfully discarded until a lesser man is in charge."
TEX_fire_with_fire:0 "Fight Fire with Fire"
TEX_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "The ideological fight against the political and social enemies of America has been done thus far with welfare and incentives. Now President Long is ready to stop pulling his punches against the social resistance to Share the Wealth. We must use every measure possible to stop the boat of the nation from turning over."
TEX_commodity_controls:0 "Commodity Controls"
TEX_commodity_controls_desc:0 "The farmers of this nation have been squeezed for too long, despite their goods fueling the rest of America! We shall implement a new Department of Economics with stronger powers to take a pro-consumer and pro-farmer stance. It will start with nationalizing utility companies that took an anti-AUS stance and purchasing agricultural goods."
TEX_farm_subsidies:0 "Farm Subsidies"
TEX_farm_subsidies_desc:0 "We can save the common farmer with the proper injection of good old American cash. The government will now subsidize farmers so they will not lose money growing the goods America needs and double down on purchasing excess goods for stockpiling during prosperous times."
TEX_keynesian_economics:0 "Keynesian Economics"
TEX_keynesian_economics_desc:0 "The government must ensure the American people never again suffer as they did under the Great Depression. Hoover's inability to rescue the economy nearly destroyed the USA, so we will follow the lead of economic progressives in adopting the recommendations of John Maynard Keynes to use a looser fiscal policy as a tool to fight unemployment."
TEX_scientific_board:0 "Scientific Board"
TEX_scientific_board_desc:0 "The Farmer-Labor Political Federation and the AFP shall enter a symbiotic relationship in embracing scientific planning for basic utilities and commodities while rejecting the radicals desire to do this for other goods. A scientific planning committee will be created to aid the DoE in distributing utility goods and purchasing goods from farmers directly."
TEX_coops_plan:0 "Co-op Plan"
TEX_coops_plan_desc:0 "A popular concept in both wings of the AFP, farm coops allow for farmers to share their resources with one another. We will have experts organize both supply and market coops depending on region so they may improve their agricultural output and economic well-being before having the committee register farmers to a national credit cooperative."
TEX_radical_economics:0 "Labor Economics"
TEX_radical_economics_desc:0 "We can't keep relying on traditional economic systems to serve us if we keep them on life support. A true labor-friendly economy must be supported, with any unemployed citizen being able to register for a commonwealth job in which commonwealths will create production based on use. These will be traded with other commonwealths according to the calculations of the committee."
TEX_banks_for_america:0 "Banks for America"
TEX_banks_for_america_desc:0 "It is long past time to adopt the Popular Control Plan for banking! A Central Bank will be created that will have control over the banking industry, with a board of directors directly elected by the people. 'Officers' for local banks will likewise be directly elected to control for parts of their bank not directly regaulted by the Central Bank. The bankers will do what they are supposed to: run the banks, and nothing more, as the people decide the rest."
TEX_strike_oil:0 "Strike Oil"
TEX_strike_oil_desc:0 "We can finally strike down Standard Oil, a company that decided to side with MacArthur and Oligarchs over the people. Their control of oil will be nationalized and run by the American Oil Company, a public corporation, while other oil companies will be broken up and taxed accordingly by the justice system."
TEX_utility_regulation:0 "Accessible Utilities"
TEX_utility_regulation_desc:0 "For too long utility companies have sought to extort customers of needed goods. We must interject a mix of price setting and government buyouts to make utilities accessable to all, and to increase government representation in this sector."
TEX_perfect_democracy:0 "Perfect Democracy"
TEX_perfect_democracy_desc:0 "The original Constitution set out to create the perfect union in America. This union failed and America died, but through President Long it was reborn. The President and the American people agree that the Constitution is now a document to build a more perfect democracy. The uninterrupted will of the American peoples as exerted by its leaders. Legislative elections and a less economically-influential justice system will be reimplemented as seperate entities from the executive branch."
### Pelley Path ###
TEX_christian_party_victory:0 "Christian Party Victory"
TEX_christian_party_victory_desc:0 "In an outcome that has shocked both the nation and onlookers abroad, Huey Long and the America First Party have lost the first elections in America since the conclusion of the civil war. William Dudley Pelley, chairman of the Christian Party and Chief of the Silver Legion, has won both a slim majority in congress and secured the highest office in the land."
TEX_defend_democracy:0 "Defend Democracy"
TEX_defend_democracy_desc:0 "Before his election, the President was called many things. A legionnaire, a syndicalist, a populist tyrant, and so much more. Yet he has always claimed to be dedicated to upholding the American republic and the values on which it was founded. We shall implement a judicial bill that will affirm our committment to trial by jury and the powers of the court, and increase penalties for corruption."
TEX_organize_new_elections:0 "Organize New Elections"
TEX_organize_new_elections_desc:0 "Despite the steady rebuilding of our great nation, some express concern that the AFP was more concerned with its own power than with restoring America. In a bid both to distance ourselves from Long and increase our own popularity it has been decided that the federal government will ensure proper oversight for all state-level elections and remove those who won their seats through legally dubious methods."
TEX_fight_the_terrorists:0 "Fight the Terrorists"
TEX_fight_the_terrorists_desc:0 "Despite the end of the civil war, fighting has not entirely ceased. Ideologues still cling to their beliefs and occasionally strike at us before slinking back into the shadows. President Pelley shall order law enforcement to begin a nationwide crackdown to root out these murderers. Further, the Silver Legion will be deployed to supplement their efforts. America is no place for cowardly traitors!"
TEX_reform_the_fbi:0 "Reform the FBI"
TEX_reform_the_fbi_desc:0 "It was inevitable that government agencies like the FBI would be shattered by the civil war. Despite their hostility to Pelley in the 1930’s the President sees the need and utility of such an organization. Once freed from the grip of Hoover and his gang of sycophants and given proper oversight, they will help ensure the wellbeing of the republic and the upholding of our great laws!"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism:0 "Outlaw Syndicalism"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism_desc:0 "The SPA’s attempt to destroy our nation has cemented President Pelley's suspicions that these traitors cannot be allowed to legally spread their filth. Effective immediately, all Marxist, Syndicalist, Bolshevist, and other vocal revolutionary left groups will be considered seditious and effectively outlawed. Some may complain that this is deeply authoritarian, but sometimes such measures are needed."
TEX_political_rehabilitation:0 "Political Rehabilitation"
TEX_political_rehabilitation_desc:0 "Despite the inherent evil of their leaders, do we not see that the average syndicalist is simply a man who wishes to have bread on his table? Thus we will direct the Department of Justice to begin drafting lists of currently imprisoned (non-leading) radicals and offer them clemency in return for a renunciation of their former beliefs and a written statement to never again support such causes."
TEX_national_command_structure:0 "National Command Structure"
TEX_national_command_structure_desc:0 "Despite our recent political success, infighting is abundant within the Legion. Local commanders complain of inconsistent orders, accountants skim off the top, and desertion is increasingly commonplace. This is unacceptable and damaging, not only to the Legion, but to America as a whole. The President will call a meeting of top Silver Legionaries to formalize a better command system."
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety:0 "Build Silver Lodges"
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety_desc:0 "The Silver Lodges were a grand idea devised by Pelley and his top commanders before the Civil War. The idea would involve the Legion purchasing lands on which to build command centers, in-order to facilitate recruitment. With many Lodges destroyed in the fighting, we should further our commitment to the Legion and direct the treasury to allocate funds to units so that they may build new headquarters."
TEX_wrangle_congress:0 "Wrangle Congress"
TEX_wrangle_congress_desc:0 "Despite the Christian Party having won the election, President Pelley has still found our politicians to be a bickering and gridlocked sort. Whilst his legislation does pass, it often takes too much time and requires far too much politicking for Pelley's liking. The solution to this is clear; utilize the radio as our new platform and decry those shysters who would hold up America’s future for their petty games."
TEX_pdol:0 "Expand the Department of Labor"
TEX_pdol_desc:0 "Pelley gained most of his following from his radical economic proposals and the time has come to begin implementing these grand ideas. This monumental effort will begin with a vast expansion of the Department of Labor: in each and every county across our nation, a DoL office will be opened. This will set the groundwork for a truly staggering effort to transform the American economy."
TEX_universal_jobs_registry:0 "Universal Jobs Registry"
TEX_universal_jobs_registry_desc:0 "With the DoL properly expanded, in each county a grand registry of each business and every possible position will be compiled and paired with a list of every worker in that county. The work will be commprehensive, to say the least. The DoL will use this combination to ensure that every American can easily and quickly find work, and when a worker cannot find work in one county, the offices will cooperate and attempt to find jobs for all who need them."
TEX_the_silver_rangers:0 "Expand the Silver Rangers"
TEX_the_silver_rangers_desc:0 "The Silver Rangers are the law enforcement group of the Silver Legion. They work to ensure that dues are paid, regulations are upheld, and that the demeanor of the Legion is in line with what the Chief and President desires. Our government is growing more popular by the day, and it has become apparent that they will need a recruitment drive of their own, lest our whole organization implode in on itself."
TEX_christian_commonwealth:0 "The Christian Commonwealth"
TEX_christian_commonwealth_desc:0 "The time has come for Pelley’s most grand idea to be put into motion. The Christian Commonwealth is a vast overhaul of the entire American economy into a hybrid system. In this system, private businesses can still exist, but they will all be subservient to and part of the Commonwealth Corporation. Furthermore all banks will be absorbed into a Central Treasury Bank which will be responsible for distributing credit."
TEX_annual_dividends:0 "Annual Dividends"
TEX_annual_dividends_desc:0 "With the Commonwealth system coming together the next ambitious step must be taken. In every county, a Treasury Bank will be opened and every native-born or naturalized American given an identification number and bank checkbook. From this moment forward, every American will be guaranteed an annual number of credits to ensure that none of our countrymen shall be subjected to the deepest depths of poverty."
TEX_gallahad_fellowship:0 "Galahad Fellowship"
TEX_gallahad_fellowship_desc:0 "Pelley's original Galahad College taught a wide variety of topics, including Christian economics, esotericism and Pelley’s Liberation Doctrine, which has since grown into Soulcraft. While the college closed during the civil war, Pelley has declared the time has come not only for Galahad College to be re-opened, but for the Galahad Fellowship to be formed and sister schools to be opened nationwide."
TEX_universal_education:0 "Universal Education"
TEX_universal_education_desc:0 "Is it not imperative for a society that the next generation be well educated? The President certainly believes so. Pelley has introduced measures to guarantee that every American youth will be granted (depending on the student) either a college scholarship or enrollment in a trade school. The youth will praise our names and future generations will be better equipped to carry on our grand experiment."
TEX_referendum_voting:0 "Referendum Voting"
TEX_referendum_voting_desc:0 "It is time to introduce the CP's proposed reforms to the legislative system. Firstly, we shall allow voters to eject their congressman if they believe they have alienated their constituents. Next, we shall implement a final step in the legislative process where all congressional legislation must require the majority approval of voters it would impact."
TEX_a_better_america:0 "A Better America"
TEX_a_better_america_desc:0 "Though many feared what would become of America under our rule, we have achieved greatness. Every American has a stable income from the Commonwealth, our democracy has been expanded, and Christian values have been restored to their rightful place. To complete out goals we shall fully integrate the so-called "Wards" into the Commonwealth and re-introduce the traditional American Bill of Rights."
### La Follete Path ###
TEX_progressive_party:0 "National Progressive Party"
TEX_progressive_party_desc:0 "The National Progressives Philip Follete and Robert M. La Follette Jr have gathered enough progressive and moderate votes to overcome the AFP machine! The future shall be a forward-thinking one!"
TEX_legacy_of_fighting_bob:0 "Venerating Fighting Bob"
TEX_legacy_of_fighting_bob_desc:0 "Bob LaFollete was the original inspiration for the National Progressive Party and supported the foundation of both Progressive Parties. We will pass the LaFollete Bill in his name which will guarantee workers the right to unionize without fear of being fired."
TEX_peace_not_war:0 "People over Arms"
TEX_peace_not_war_desc:0 "Ensuring that the military growth we've seen in the past couple years would not destroy the Republic was one of our promises. It results in needless war and more MacArthurs, and we will see to it that this does not occur. We will shift current military spending to civilian contracts and our future education programs, for our governments stands for peace, not war."
TEX_wisconsin_idea:0 "The Wisconsin Idea"
TEX_wisconsin_idea_desc:0 "The ideal of all men being educated was a dream held by the Founding Fathers, but now it can be a reality. We will follow the Wisconsin Model and, after expanding current schools, fund higher education and trade schools so it costs next-to-nothing for qualified citizens to enter higher education."
TEX_modernized_congress:0 "Modernized Congress"
TEX_modernized_congress_desc:0 "Congress can not hope to stay up with the nation if it never modernizes itself. We should update this institution so that the bitter arguments and inaction of recent times will be a relic of the past."
TEX_farmer_labor_alliance:0 "Farmer-Labor Organization"
TEX_farmer_labor_alliance_desc:0 "We must organize rural and urban workers so that they may intermingle, share mutual aid, and have a shared political lobby. We will campaign for more to join the Farmer-Labor Party and collaborate closely with it."
TEX_proportional_representation:0 "Proportional Representation"
TEX_proportional_representation_desc:0 "An idea long supported by Progressives such as George Norris and Bob La Follete, the first-past-the-post system of voting is badly outdated and encourages party corruption and machines. Proportional Representation must be campaigned for in each state, and the constitution will need to be reformed for such a voting system. This will occur when enough support is gathered, of course."
TEX_granger_coops:0 "The National Grange"
TEX_granger_coops_desc:0 "The National Grange is an honorable American institution that allows the rich and poor to mingle in rural communities and for the former to aid the latter. Encouraging rural mutual aid and farm support, we will have census employees help farmers register for the Grange and give it a grant to expand it."
TEX_plumb_plan:0 "The Plumb Plan"
TEX_plumb_plan_desc:0 "Named for Glenn E. Plumb's plan for cooperative railroads on a national level, the government will sell bonds and use them to purchase railroads. These will be combined in a single public corporation, partially run by the government. The workers and management shall run it in equal measure, and 50% of the profits will go to the workers."
TEX_private_public_planning:0 "Private-Public Planning"
TEX_private_public_planning_desc:0 "The expansion of government planning need not imply overriding private citizens. We will hire a wide range of government planners and contractors who will work with citizens and local councils to help them build ideal housing and local projects."
TEX_empowered_executive:0 "Empowered Executive"
TEX_empowered_executive_desc:0 "The presidency must be able to respond to crises with more vigor if the recent disasters the United States suffered are any example. The President will be given more leniency on economic executive orders, so that they may overcome an inefficient Congress when the need arises."
TEX_democratic_safeguards:0 "Democratic Safeguards"
TEX_democratic_safeguards_desc:0 "Simply because the President has more power does not make him a MacArthurite. Transpareny in government is absolutely neccessary, so we will allow reporters to more easily enter Congress and empower the Judiciary Branch. We shall keep our democracy safe!"
TEX_modern_farms:0 "Modern Farms"
TEX_modern_farms_desc:0 "Farms were devastated by the war, yes, but they were already collapsing before that point. They must be updated with modern instruments and crops. We will supply farmers with the best seeds available and purchase additional farm equipment for them. Further, new technology will increase their yield."
TEX_national_infrastructure_plan:0 "National Infrastructure Plan"
TEX_national_infrastructure_plan_desc:0 "It's time to make a mass effort towards not only rebuilding, but improving our infrastructure. A mass infrastructure plan will begin with a national infrstructure plan that is friendly to locals and will contract small business owners to do the work wherever possible."
TEX_sewer_socialism:0 "Sewer Socialism"
TEX_sewer_socialism_desc:0 "Our cities desperately need a rework of their power and water. We will invest in building the neccessary infrastructure demanded by cities, including a mass effort to update their electricity and public health systems. Our cities shall be clean once and for all."
TEX_public_lands:0 "Public Lands"
TEX_public_lands_desc:0 "One of our most important environmental ideas involves the idea of greater public lands. This will allow the federal government control over areas that can be turned into national parks, monuments, and most importantly, government projects."
TEX_greenback_currency:0 "Greenback Currency"
TEX_greenback_currency_desc:0 "The only result of past governmental obsession with stomping out inflation was to reward the lender class and further impoverish those in debts, such as farmers. The Greenback Currency will be named for the old populist party idea and will not be tied to the gold standard. With its introduction, we will create a small amount of inflation to help those in debt."
### Texas Path ###
TEX_pappy_odaniel:0 "Pappy O'Daniel"
TEX_pappy_odaniel_desc:0 "W. Lee O'Daniel, the most prominent right-wing America Firster in Texas, is now in control of the entire American Union State. His administration is almost certain to increase the influence of Texas within the government, but he promises to represent the entirety of America during his time in power. His charismatic radio speeches and calls for prayer have inspired millions, and now we will see what this outsider does with real power..."
TEX_five_point_plan:0 "Five Point Plan"
TEX_five_point_plan_desc:0 "To counter the calls for a "Share the Wealth" plan, O'Daniel has decided to create his own "Five Point Plan". The plan will involve raising millions in new revenue, banning deficit spending, abolishing unnecessary taxes, abolishing capital punishment, and of course, appointing a state-audited budget director. O'Daniel hopes this plan will win the hearts of minds of his people, but there is much work to be done to implement these proposals..."
TEX_texas_values:0 "Texas Values"
TEX_texas_values_desc:0 "From the founding of the American Union State, farmers across the Great Plains have shared influence with Huey Long's Louisiana allies, and yet Texas has not garnered the power it deserves. Now, this will change, and Texas will take its rightful place at the head of the Union State cause, moderating Long's radical proposals with homemade Texas populism, toughness, and religiosity."
TEX_old_age_pensions:0 "Old-Age Pensions"
TEX_old_age_pensions_desc:0 "One area where Huey Long was undoubtedly right was on old-age pensions. O'Daniel made this one of his foremost promises, and he intends to follow through on it. However, since he is unwilling to engage in deficit spending and reluctant to raise taxes, we must find some way to raise the funds for this proposal."
TEX_industrialization_committee:0 "Industrialization Committees"
TEX_industrialization_committee_desc:0 "The Great Plains as a whole are perhaps the least industrialized region of America. If we want these states to have a place, if we want farmers and ranchers to have a voice, we must pursue industrialization. Further, through industrialization, we can bring desperately-needed investment into the country, investment that can help us get back on our feet after the Civil War. For a new America!"
TEX_soil_conservation_act:0 "Soil Conservation Act"
TEX_soil_conservation_act_desc:0 "One of the greatest tragedies of recent times was the Dust Bowl, which devastated our farmers and ranchers and drove millions into despair. This act will hopefully work against soil erosion and by proxy, prevent further environmental devastation from wind and other forces. With this act, we will never suffer another Dust Bowl."
TEX_fight_wasteful_spending:0 "Fight Wasteful Spending"
TEX_fight_wasteful_spending_desc:0 "Some of W. Lee O'Daniel's largest foes in Texas were those who promised their constituents money one way or another but then spent it elsewhere, either to enrich themselves or otherwise pursue their own interests. In fact, O'Daniel believes a significant amount of government spending is nothing more than corruption, and it is rarely used to truly benefit the common man. We must change this, and make spending a more economical, and representative, affair."  
TEX_slice_taxes:0 "Slice Taxes"
TEX_slice_taxes_desc:0 "Pappy O'Daniel ran on cutting poll taxes and taxes overall, with the idea being to ease pressure on everyday Americans and give them more spending power. Just like in Texas however, this proposal has been met with opposition nationally by other factions of the American Union State. We must reassure them by finding other ways to pay for our programs..." 
TEX_radio_showmanship:0 "Radio Showmanship"
TEX_radio_showmanship_desc:0 "From his early days in the Flour industry, O'Daniel has used the radio to great effect. Through the radio, he has reached a larger audience than ever before, and this audience now clamors to hear his reassuring speeches in even the darkest of days. Even better, O'Daniel has also managed to use his radio following as a political weapon against those who wish to block his agenda."
TEX_reconcile_big_business:0 "Reconcile Big Business"
TEX_reconcile_big_business_desc:0 "Originally, the American Union State did not have much industry, suffering from geography and populist rhetoric that businessmen viewed as being against them. However, O'Daniel believes populism and business can work together, and this is exactly what he plans to do. With more supporters in this community, we can truly compete with our rivals and ensure prosperity after the Civil War."
TEX_labor_agitators:0 "Labor Agitators"
TEX_labor_agitators_desc:0 "The time has come to fight the outsiders who have been brought into our towns and cities to agitate among honest union men. Union organizations and outside infiltrators turn citizens who are trying to make a living into vicious revolutionaries. If we do not counteract this threat immediately, everything we have fought for will perish."
TEX_sunday_broadcasts:0 "Sunday Broadcasts"
TEX_sunday_broadcasts_desc:0 "To help increase morale and his own support, O'Daniel wishes to hold Sunday broadcasts after Church that will further convey a religious and patriotic message to all our citizens. In these times, such a message is needed more than ever, and we cannot forget who we are as a nation. Perhaps we can even bring the disparate political factions of the Union State to our side."
TEX_ten_commandments:0 "The Ten Commandments"
TEX_ten_commandments_desc:0 "One of the parts of O'Daniel's platform that separated him from his opponents was his emphasis on the Ten Commandments. These rules, and the Golden Rule, have informed Pappy O'Daniel's approach to politics. Now, we must ensure they also inform the daily lives of citizens and soldiers alike, and good God-fearing Americans will populate the country once more."
TEX_hillbilly_boys:0 "The Hillbilly Boys"
TEX_hillbilly_boys_desc:0 "Pappy O'Daniel's ability to entertain audiences in-person and on the radio with his bands was something that helped him catapult to the national stage. The most useful group in this endeavor was his "Hillybilly Boys" band. With their help in concerts and on the radio, thousands learned of O'Daniel and his message to save America. Now, perhaps it is time to repay them for their assistance, but how?"
TEX_power_to_farmers:0 "Power to Farmers"
TEX_power_to_farmers_desc:0 "It was once the case that the everyday American was a farmer who took care of his crops and did his best to serve his country. That image is gone today, and as a result, America has lost its identity. We must do what we can to empower the downtrodden Western farmer in this country: it is the only way we will ever recover from our present crises."
TEX_obligations_to_our_children:0 "Obligations to our Children"
TEX_obligations_to_our_children_desc:0 "For years, politicians have promised much needed funding for schools, teachers, and orphans, and yet these corrupt officials never followed through on their promises. We must do right by God and by our people, and give these groups the funding they were promised. O'Daniel may be against new funding, but as far as he is concerned, a promise made is a promise kept."
TEX_oil_boom:0 "National Oil Boom"
TEX_oil_boom_desc:0 "Thanks to our new industry and the ongoing discovery of oil in Texas and elsewhere in the country, we are experiencing a boom in oil production. This new resource will bring us prosperity, but more importantly, it may be a stable source of funding for O'Daniel's programs, assuming we impose a small tax on oil and gas. The businesses will surely not mind, given the sheer profits they have enjoyed lately, and our people will rejoice."
TEX_protect_poor_whites:0 "Protect Poor Whites"
TEX_protect_poor_whites_desc:0 "The poor White man has been left behind in recent years, with the government acting instead in the interests of businessmen or immigrants. If we take care to protect the poorest among us through charity and other means, we will build a stronger nation as a whole. The common White man will prosper as never before!"
TEX_beautiful_america:0 "Beautiful America"
TEX_beautiful_america_desc:0 "This land of the free, established by our ancestors, will be made beautiful once more under the leadership of Pappy O'Daniel. We are proud of our poorest farmers and workers, and no matter where an American lives, they will live in the most beautiful country we know."

### Reconstruction ###
TEX_rebuilding_the_country:0 "Rebuilding the Country"
TEX_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "A long struggle to push through the Federalist, Syndicalist, and ODP forces in America has left the victorious Union State economically drained. The hand that unifies the country can either promote a deficit spending regime, or an austere policy that limits direct intervention in the market."
TEX_national_recovery:0 "National Recovery Administration"
TEX_national_recovery_desc:0 "The NRA emphasizes the use of public domain and work-living units instead of 'cut throat competition' of regular contract work. Workers in the NRA will receive the benefit of a minimum wages and price-controlled work environments in constant to the old Company Store model."
TEX_public_works:0 "Public Works Administration"
TEX_public_works_desc:0 "The ability to generate electricity, transport water, and ensure safe and efficient travel was lost during the civil war. However, the Public Works Administration will fix all that. It is a fund that will ensure contractors pay their employees fairly, so that their are better incentivized to help rebuild."
TEX_research_projects:0 "National Education Administration"
TEX_research_projects_desc:0 "In the wake of the collapse of the CSA, the National Education Association has folded and its members have dispersed. With most teachers being apolitical and the union never being able to exert much partisan power over them, it is a strong candidate for rehabilitation by the new American government."
TEX_civil_works_adminstration:0 "National Public Works"
TEX_civil_works_adminstration_desc:0 "As a nation, America lost a great deal of its labor supply to the fighting and poverty of recent years. The leader has pushed an executive order authorizing the creation of an agency to employ manual laborers to fill out the spaces in employment for NRA projects."
TEX_the_ccc:0 "National Valley Authority"
TEX_the_ccc_desc:0 "The damage done to America by the civil war has been considerable, and even approaching the idea of reconstruction seems like an insurmountable problem. An idea has been floating around the capital of establishing a public body to oversee not only the reconstruction effort but looking into how to rebuild a better America once that project is complete."
TEX_rural_electrification:0 "Rural Electrification"
TEX_rural_electrification_desc:0 "The electricity network throughout the country has regressed to that of the 1910s. This is un-American and we need to ensure that our constituents can be properly informed about our nation's glory. Further, electrification will give our rural areas access to much "
TEX_wealth_cap:0 "Wealth Cap" 
TEX_the_aaa:0 "Farm Relief"
TEX_the_aaa_desc:0 "Farms are the basis of the American economy, but they have seen devestation wrought from the Civil War. Only through a combination of direct farm aid via lump cash payouts to compensate for damaged equipment, purchasing farm goods, and contracting industrial areas to build capital instruments for farming can we hope to begin recovery."
TEX_farm_security_administration:0 "Farm Securities Act"
TEX_farm_security_administration_desc:0 "Sharecroppers and tenant farmers make up a significant portion of our constituency, especially in the core of the South and the Great Plains. We must extend a credit program with very low interest rates to farmers who apply to resettle land, especially land in the old Steel Belt."
TEX_begin_reconstruction:0 "Rebuild Urban Housing"
TEX_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "The civil war has blasted our country to pieces. Large parts of the rural country are naught but mud and ashes, while countless cities have been reduced to smoldering rubble. We shall set to work developing new housing and infrastructure as soon as possible."
TEX_harsh_reconstruction:0 "Seize Treacherous Wealth"
TEX_harsh_reconstruction_desc:0 "Congress has sided with us in condemning these companies that betrayed the American people. Lists of majority shareholders in traitorous companies have been seized, and the executive officers of companies that have exploited workers behind the facade of government are now on trial."
TEX_reconciliation:0 "Conditional Forgiveness"
TEX_reconciliation_desc:0 "Congress finally won out against the executive branch, and has decided not to bring charges against seditious companies. Executive officers were pressured to resign in order for their company to be re-listed however, but ultimately the shareholders are deemed innocent of wrongdoing."
TEX_employment_expansion:0 "Employment Expansion"
TEX_employment_expansion_desc:0 "We will continue to help our workforce get back on its feet. With new housing and infrastructure being built, unemployment has significantly gone down, and our economy has almost recovered from the Civil War."
TEX_reconstruction_is_over:0 "Reconstruction is Over"
TEX_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "The course of reconstruction has revealed the true ideological basis for why Hoover was unable to fix the economy. The wiser constituents of these windbags have largely voted them out by now, as our GDP rises and the American standard of living rises and even exceeds pre-war levels."
TEX_infrastructure_effort:0 "Infrastructure Efforts"
TEX_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "Technology is rapidly changing our world. The automobile is becoming the main mode of transportation for many people, and we must adjust accordingly. Let us build up our roads and bridges to handle this new demand, and create a national highway system."
TEX_recognize_philantrophers:0 "Recognize Philanthropists"
TEX_recognize_philantrophers_desc:0 "While many members of the wealthy opposed the AUS' efforts to redistribute goods, even within a capitalist economy, there are some who remained neutral in this debate. We should speak to them about donating to charity and award them medals for doing so, so they may set an example for others with the means to donate."
TEX_Grand_Army_of_the_Republic:0 "The Grand Army of the Republic"
TEX_Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_desc:0 "An organization from the first American Civil War intended to represent veterans, the organization is on its last legs due to few veterans still surviving. However, we can revive the organization by having recent ACW vets join, giving them a society with internal aid, organization and a means of easily communicating their interests while providing us with new allies."
TEX_dependent_and_disability_act:0 "Dependent and Disability Act"
TEX_dependent_and_disability_act_desc:0 "Based on an older Civil War Act, the GAR is pushing for us to revive the Dependent and Disability Act which would provide Federal pension aid for disabled veterans and widows of dead veterans. This is a necessary reinvestment in those who are most dependent on us, which will prevent them from falling into poverty."
TEX_department_of_public_safety:0 "Department of Public Safety"
TEX_department_of_public_safety_desc:0 "The Department of Public Safety will not only provide jobs to potential government workers but help regulate industry and consumer products to be safer, rewarding those who best comply with tax breaks. We will do our best to cut down on work accidents."
TEX_work_programs:0 "Veteran Work Programs"
TEX_work_programs_desc:0 "Veterans are still out of work, partly due to their lack of opportunity. Our work programs will retrain veterans so that they may better enter the job market, and subsidize those markets. Veterans should live a life of dignity, not poverty."
TEX_state_grants:0 "State Grants"
TEX_state_grants_desc:0 "Sometimes, local officials know the best place to spend their resources. State grants will entrust governors and state governments loyal to our Republic with how they decide to rebuild the industries that best suit them, and who needs the most support."

TEX_From_a_Militia_to_a_force_desc:0 "So far, the only forces the Kingfish has commanded have been small-time militias in urban enviroments.

TEX_improve_artillery:0 "Improve our Artillery"

TEX_focus_on_concentration:0 "Focus on Fire Concentration"
TEX_focus_on_concentration_desc:0 "Force Concentration has been an invaluable tactic for every commander since the times of the Roman Legions. Given our nation's limited resources when fighting against the traitors of America, we should once again reconsider this strategy for our artillery, concentrating it on specific sectors to achieve breakthroughs for our infantry to take advantage of."
AUS_focus_on_swiftness:0 "Focus on Swiftness"
AUS_focus_on_swiftness_desc:0 "Modern Warfare has come a long way since the trenches that once plagued the Western Front. Fast advances with tanks followed by motorized units is now not a dream, but a necesity of a successful fighting force. As such, our nation's army should be at the forefront of this development."
TEX_focus_on_command:0 "Focus on Command"
TEX_focus_on_command_desc:0 "Our enemies in the civil war can be described simply as disorganized and demoralized militias with occassional remnants of the former Army presenting any real resistance.

TEX_take_the_fight_abroad_desc:0 "With our victory at home, we now have to prepare to take the fight to whatever shore we need to take, to whatever mountain we have to cross, and against whatever foe we need to face.

TEX_increase_military_spending:0 "Increase Military Spending"
TEX_increase_military_spending_desc:0 "The Civil War devastated the American civilian industry, but has made the military industrial complex quite a profit.

TEX_military_research:0 "Military Research"

TEX_new_arms_factories:0 "New Arms Factories"
TEX_new_arms_factories_desc:0 "The main trouble with creating a military industry is that facilities under our control were already reduced from the Great Depression to reduce redundancies. We have had to expand facilities and repurpose old buildings in order to manufacture parts needed for heavy weapons in our territory."
TEX_war_bonds:0 "War Bonds"
TEX_war_bonds_desc:0 "Funding the war effort will require more than victory gardens and volunteer-ism. Liquid assets are in short supply, especially with our economic programs ongoing. We can capitalize on public trust and implement War Bonds, as most other free nations do."

TEX_army_bonus_bill:0 "Army Bonus Bill"
TEX_army_bonus_bill_desc:0 "Combat hardens boys into men and men into solid steel - unshakeable pillars of Americanism. Only a fool would leave veterans such as these by the wayside.

TEX_Lightning_Joe:0 "Lightning Joe"
TEX_Lightning_Joe_desc:0 "Given how outdated the Army organization has become, General Devers has approached us with a reform plan. He has noted that victory will require the industry on the Plains to adapt to the needs of the artillery branch, which shall lead the way to defeat the traitors in the East and West.

TEX_Terrible_Terry:0 "Terrible Terry"
TEX_Terrible_Terry_desc:0 "The uncouth General Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. has put forward a clear-thinking plan based on superior tactics, combat preparation, and pressing the enemy wherever they are weak.

TEX_towards_motorization:0 "Towards Motorization"
TEX_towards_motorization_desc:0 "Despite the obvious superiorities of motorized vehicles over cavalry, older officers have been reluctant to make the switch, stubbornly arguing for cavalry superiority.

TEX_expand_ACTS:0 "Expand the Air Corps Tactical School"
TEX_expand_ACTS_desc:0 "We are lucky enough that the American Army in the past relegated air officer training to the deep South, as we now possess access to the instalations and officers from the Air Corps Tactical School in Maxwell Field, Alabama. However, in order to surpass the School set up in Langley Field in Virginia, we will need to expand on our instalations."

TEX_naval_bombers_desc:0 "With the shortcomings of our navy for protecting our shores, the air force has the duty to also protect the shores of our nation for whatever cost against any enemy who dare set foot in our homeland. As such, we will seek to complement the Navy's patrols with naval bombers scouting and intercepting any vessels whenever our fleet is too spread out or too far away to do so."
TEX_Weyland_plan:0 "Parsons Plan"

TEX_ideological_neutrality:0 "Ideological Neutrality"
TEX_ideological_neutrality_desc:0 "The ideologically-driven conflicts that are now commonplace in our world are worthless in our view.

TEX_oppose_american_syndicalism:0 "Oppose American Syndicalism"
TEX_oppose_american_syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism is too extreme for our tastes. We should make sure that it does not become commonplace in the New World. We should target syndicalist nations in our hemisphere and suggest they either change course or, if they resist, face our intervention."

TEX_investigate_war_lobbyists_desc:0 "We are swarmed by lobbyists on a daily basis. Instead of letting these people get away with a slap on the wrist, why don't we investigate them?

TEX_break_war_mongerers:0 "Stop American War Mongerers"
TEX_break_war_mongerers_desc:0 "We've had enough of Canada intervening in our affairs. We have kicked the British out of our lands before, but if we are to commit to a new Monroe Doctrine, we have to go farther than that. What shall our next course of action towards them be?"
TEX_contain_hostile_leftism:0 "Strike Left Expansionists"
TEX_contain_hostile_leftism_desc:0 "When leftism goes too far, we must not be afraid to stop it in its tracks. Aggressive left-wing regimes now drown out the more peaceful ones and have significantly drive up world tension. We should act to stop them before it is too late."
TEX_end_carles:0 "Liberate Carlesian Argentina"
TEX_end_carles_desc:0 "Argentina has great potential, but its people suffer under the boot of a dictator. They did not choose him, and he has not given them their proper respect as a leader.

TEX_mutual_trade:0 "Mutual Trade"
TEX_mutual_trade_desc:0 "We have no wishes to dominate the nations of Latin America. We want a true brotherhood with these countries.

TEX_research_agreement:0 "Research Initiative"

We should be ready for any move they could make."

TEX_naval_prominence:0 "Naval Prominence"
TEX_naval_prominence_desc:0 "Though we controlled the Great American Plains during the Civil War, we shouldn't forget Texas.

TEX_defensive_doctrine:0 "Defensive Military Tactics"
TEX_defensive_doctrine_desc:0 "We should never forget 1812, when foreign invaders burned our capital to the ground. If we want to prevent this from happening again, we should make sure we can defend out country at all costs.

TEX_aid_paraguay:0 "Favor Paraguay"
TEX_aid_paraguay_desc:0 "As strange as it may sound, Paraguay was one of our closest allies in the Civil War. We should return the favor and aid them in their time of need.

TEX_business_of_neutrality:0 "Pragmatic Trade"

This last title holder, Smedley Butler, had foolishly sided with the syndicalists. Whomever taken this position will symbolically represent the veterans of the United States military in society, and thus our choice is important. The most common name floated up is General Terry de la Mesa Allen Jr, although he would need to pressured into the position given his hatred of bureaucracy. Right-wing Longists that Gerald L.K.

unionstate.11.d:0 "The years of service to America has worn Father Charles Coughlin down. In between his radio shows and his Social Justice publications, he rarely has time to promote Share Our Wealth Societies. This coupled with his increasing emotional instability has led to this day. President [TEX.GetLeader], while silent on this issue, sympathizes with the Jewish citizens for whom Coughlin has flirted with demonizing as he walks the line on lumping them in with international bankers.

unionstate.14.d:0 "When the Honorable Hugo Black was appointed office on the coattails of Huey Long's victory, very few had bothered to check his past associations. This is why today's newspaper shocked President [TEX.GetLeader] so greatly. An expose found Hugo Black's Klan membership. Hugo Black responded to the press by profusely apologizing, and saying that his membership was just perfunctory in order to get elected in Alabama. While Black's judicial record does paint him as a liberal, this flies directly in the face of Long's anti-Klan campaign. Should we fire Hugo Black?"

These new employees were directed by William Lemke, and were paid on the federal payroll. Now there exists a tension between the old and the new in Share Our Wealth.

A social commentary by director Erich von Stroheim about the corrupting power of wealth is seen by many as a parable to the state of America before the Civil War. This massive four-hour epic film had it's ending altered from the original book, where a kind stranger intervenes in the death struggle of McTeague and whisks him away from Death Valley back to civilisation."

As the brother of President Huey Long, Earl has been immune from prosecution and is usually handled delicately by the press. Earl's administeration has been charged to distribute veteran benefits and basic income to the people of Louisiana, with the assumption that all loyal Americans would be deserving of this welfare. A group of concerned citizens, including hundreds of veterans and poor from Norther Louisiana have gathered in Baton Rouge, claiming that Earl Long has withheld their income and benefits. Governor Earl tried to speak to the crowd, claiming that the funds have yet to arrive from the capital, and to disperse until that day. The protesters, many of whom were black veterans, began chanting for Earl's resignation. While accounts differ about what happened next, anywhere from 20-50 people lie dead among the protesters. It now lies with President Huey to pick up the pieces. Governor Earl is appealing to his brother to help him with damage control. The press are not quite at a fever pitch, and any move Huey does could swing public opinion at the moment. "

The book is a science fiction about a scientist who invents a machine that can turn a black man white. This invention turns society upside down, and challenges ideas on race and the one drop principle. The book continues with the revelation that all the characters, both white and black, are mixed race, and the entire principle of racial supremacy collapses. While there were concerns that the book would be censored due to its veiled attacks against both white supremacists and black leaders, it appears that President [TEX.GetLeader] enjoys the book."

unionstate.21.d:0 "As it is clear the AUS is attempting to take up the former mantle of the original American Government, there have been increasing demands for an election to decide the future leader of America in a democratic manner. With a political structure that mimics the old electoral structure of America, the progressives and leftover democratic party have been most vocal in this endeavor. As we rely on their support just to keep afloat, there is not much we can do but agree for now."
unionstate.21.a:0 "Very well!"

unionstate.2100.t:0 "National Progressive Campaign"
unionstate.2100.d:0 "The National Progressive Party has expanded beyond the La Follete families immediate domain and is now dominant in many farm regions in the North and Mid-West. Campaigning on a platform of political reform and of endorsing progressive economics free of "corruption", a clear reference to the AFP. Having already absorbed most of the remaining Republican Party, they poss a significant threat to the left-wing of the AFP and, of course, have already eaten into our progressive and farmer support, leaving some to say we should pay more lip service to our left-wing."
unionstate.2100.a:0 "Promise them more!"
unionstate.2100.b:0 "No, we would alienate the right"

unionstate.2101.t:0 "Texas Democrats Attempt a Resurgence"
unionstate.2101.d:0 "After a long struggle between Ma Ferguson and W. Lee O'Daniel in Texas, it seems that O'Daniel has emerged as the standardbearer of Texas Democrats. However, he is not content with this outcome, and he has begun to campaign on the national stage. O'Daniel hopes to bring his populist message and conservative economic policies to all Americans, and though he is officially a Democrat, he has deviated from traditional Democratic messaging and campaigning in his embrace of some of Huey Long's rhetoric. His campaign, drawing from his radio audience and traditional Democrat voters overall, has quickly amassed support nationwide, and O'Daniel threatens to overshadow Long as the man Americans look up to for guidance. His charisma should not be underestimated, and perhaps we should take Texas more seriously to try and shut him up."
unionstate.2101.a:0 "Take him down!"
unionstate.2101.b:0 "Why should we take a flour salesman seriously?"

unionstate.22.t:0 "Formation of the Christian Party"
unionstate.22.d:0 "With the growth of the Silver Legion under William Dudley Pelley and the announcement of the election, the Christian Party has announced it will stand at the next elections. Eating into the support of the right-wing of the AFP and the now rump Democratic Party, the Christian Party is running on a protestant Christian Democratic platform with progressive economic policies including wealth dividends and full employment. Perhaps we should pander to our right-wing so as to stop their support?"
unionstate.22.a:0 "Yes, of course"
unionstate.22.b:0 "That would do more harm than good"

unionstate.23.t:0 "Long associate disappears!"
unionstate.23.d:0 "A shocking scandal in Louisiana took place earlier this week when Sam Irby, the uncle to Long's secretary and rumored mistress, disappeared from his hotel room in the Gardner Hotel after it is said members of the Louisiana Bureau of Criminal Identification entered the building! This is a blow to the opposition Democrats whom are rumoured to have been interviewing Irby about Long's supposed affair with Irby's niece. Already accusations of kidnapping have taken place but neither Long nor his secretary have commented on it."

unionstate.2300.d.marland:0 "The election results are in in the contest between Huey Long's AFP, Bob La Follete Jr.'s NPP and William Dudley Pelley's Christian Party, alongside E.W. Marland's Democratic Party which calls for a reintegration into the Pacific. Which shall it be?"
unionstate.2300.d.generic:0 "The election results are in in the contest between Huey Long's AFP, Bob La Follete Jr.'s NPP and William Dudley Pelley's Christian Party, with the Democratic Party being too weak to win this cycle its original main electoral stance of rejoining the Pacific becoming virtually impossible to follow through on in given its collapse. Which shall it be?"

unionstate.24.d:0 "The man widely reported kidnapped earlier this week, Sam Irby, has reappeared unharmed! Irby claims that he kidnapped himself to throw off 'less than friendly loaners', a story few actually believe. AFP opponents accuse Long of wanting to hide Irby until the election was over to avoid potential scandals that would result from the man selling stories about Huey to the press but with Irby and his dapper new clothes claiming otherwise there is nothing they can do."
unionstate.24.a:0 "How about that!"

###INITIAL EVENTS###
unionstate.26.t:0 "The Texas Devils"
unionstate.26.d:0 "The Texas Rangers are under our jurisdiction and their leader Col. Lee Simmons are loyal to us. They are currently struggling to contain the many domestic terrorist threats in our nation however. He has requested that we green light a plan to bring back famed Ranger Frank Hamer to once again tackle the Klan in our territory and provide funding to do so. This would undoubtedly weaken the Klan but perhaps their efforts would be more useful elsewhere?"
unionstate.26.a:0 "Greenlight it"
unionstate.26.b:0 "Target generic robbers instead"
unionstate.26.c:0 "Have them help train the troops instead"

unionstate.27.t:0 "Bonnie and Clyde gang"
unionstate.27.d:0 "While crime in rampant throughout the territory as criminals look to make a easy buck from the unstable nature of America one criminal group in particular has gained infamy, namely the Barrow gang. This is largely due to the sensationalist takes on Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, a couple apparently leading the gang and whom are often called Bonnie and Clyde for short. The activities of the whole gang involve mainly robberies sometimes even of banks, but increasingly members of law enforcement are getting gunned down, partly due to the heavy firepower the gang is packing. Famously Clyde Barrow himself carries a Browning Automatic Rifle. Unfortunately the gang is gaining an undeserved folksy reputation and undermining the legitimacy of the state, how should we respond?"
unionstate.27.a:0 "Send the Texas Rangers"
unionstate.27.b:0 "Send the National Guard"
unionstate.27.c:0 "We don't have the resources for this"

unionstate.28.t:0 "Pendergast Machine"
unionstate.28.d:0 "Tom Pendergast is the political boss of Kansas City and Jackson County with a reputation for running his cities as his personal fiefdom. Nonetheless, he is not very welcoming towards the Constitutional American Republic whom hope to displace him and his system with the Old Democrats and other more hardcore white supremacists and prohibitionists whom view Pendergast as a seller of vice which in all honesty he is. Certainly this does not make him the greater evil to us nor are we to him, leading to him asking for protection. His machine would undermine the AFP power and not be wholly popular but would provide the AUS as a whole with greater resources, men who could be recruited in his territory and assistance from Pendergast's organized crime allies who could make our lives easier and CAR's more difficult. On the other hand we could just run AFP candidates in his territory and scare off him and his ally mobster Charles Carrollo by threatening to charge them should they not leave. What should we do?"
unionstate.28.a:0 "Make the alliance"
unionstate.28.b:0 "Kansas City ain't big enough for the two of us"

unionstate.29.t:0 "The Southern Tenant Farmers Union"
unionstate.29.d:0 "The Southern Tenant Farmers Union is a left-wing bureau for tenant farmers legally operating within our territory and supporting the American Union State over the rightist Constitutional American Republic, whom are repressing the STFU in their territory. This makes them potentially useful allies as they can help disrupt activities within the CAR if provided funding and perhaps even giving its leader Harry Leland Mitchell a seat on our cabinet. However, some in the party are reluctant to do so due to it being widely known the STFU has heavy sympathies with some of the Combined Syndicates of America despite not being based out of their territory. Providing support will surely help us shore up support but nonetheless would increase socialist sympathies and anger social conservatives who dislike the STFU's progressive stance on race issues."
unionstate.29.a:0 "Provide some support"
unionstate.29.b:0 "Put them on Our Cabinet"
unionstate.29.c:0 "I don't think so"

unionstate.30.t:0 "Progressive Merger Proposed"
unionstate.30.d:0 "Huey's main ally in Congress and now in the AUS has long been the Midwest Progressive and Farmer-Labor organizations despite an occasionally tense relationship due to disagreements with Long's style of populism and alleged demagoguery. However a recent proposal would strengthen this alliance. It comes from Alfred Mitchell Bingham, a radical activist and lead editor of the periodical Common Sense, is supportive of progressivism, the AFP and the right-wing of the CSA and is responsible for running the American Farmer-Labor Federation. The AFLF is made up of middle-class activists organizing mainly for the working class and which has connections with the AFP, the Progressives and even Bellaymists in the CSA. Despite the Federations flexibility it's stance on economic issues revolves around economic planning when it comes to agrarian goods and recently Bingham and other members of the Federation have begun to see the AFP as the best possible route to a radical but patriotic future. They have proposed forming the American Commonwealth Co-operative Movement, under which they would openly join the AFP in a political alliance. While this would shore up our support among left-leaning activists and undermine the National Progressive Party has potential competition it could tie us to more left-wing economic policies than some of our party members are comfortable with."
unionstate.30.a:0 "Of Course Not"
unionstate.30.b:0 "Absolutely, a fantastic opportunity"

unionstate.3001.t:0 "Second Great Migration"
unionstate.3001.d:0 "Despite the attempts of the Constitutional American Republic to force black Americans to stay in their territory, an increasingly large number of Black Americans are fleeing to the North and West. The total is likely numbering in at least a million, with many seeking to settle in our territory due to its obvious proximity. In particular, the urban regions of Texas are seeing an inflow of Black migrants but the machines representing many whites, particularly the questionably loyal local Democratic Parties as well as part of the AFP, are demanding we take away their right to vote so as to not threaten their political supremacy. White populists such as Gerald L.K. Smith suggest also stopping anymore blacks from entering so as to not threaten the white working class. However, much of the AFP and Progressives disagree with this and alongside our generals see an opportunity for recruitment and potential factory workers. They recommend allowing the migrants to settle and recruiting them at once."
unionstate.3001.a:0 "Let them in"
unionstate.3001.b:0 "Let them in, but they can't vote"
unionstate.3001.c:0 "Announce we won't be taking in anymore"

unionstate.3002.t:0 "The Old Regulars"
unionstate.3002.d:0 "The Regular Democratic Organization is Louisian's political machine for conservative Democrats and are Long's traditional opponents in his home state. Despite this the two have made alliances in the past and with the "Old Regulars" having questionable loyalty to the AUS over CAR or the USA now might be the time to make another such alliance, agreeing not to run AFP candidates in Southern Louisiana in return for them not openly opposing us. Of course, some Old Regulars have already crossed over to the Old Democrats and refuse to support Long, begging the question of whether we should simply "investigate" the organization for corruption and have it basically shut down which would also increase the AFP's hold on the state. Of course, this would push the old money elite even more against Long as well as the most ardent white supremacists."
unionstate.3002.a:0 "Cede part of Louisiana"
unionstate.3002.b:0 "Investigate them"

unionstate.3003.t:0 "Black Troop Debate!"
unionstate.3003.d:0 "The question of black combat troops has long been a contentious one in the United States, with race traditionalists insisting that blacks lack the intellectual faculties to be combat troops whereas others insist this is an absurd position and simply robs us of much needed soldiers. Currently Gerald L.K. Smith leads the charge on behalf of race traditionalists, insisting that blacks can not be expected to be soldiers and gain the same benefits as white soldiers. Charles Coughlin and much the Silver Legion are in accordance with this, although Pelley himself is ambivalent about letting Northern Blacks join as combat troops he is a hardliner when it comes to Southern Blacks, insisting they lack the 'intelligence and civility' to be troops. On the other side, Jacob Devers, the AFP machine in Louisiana and the Radicals in the AUS such as the Non-Partisan League, have pushed for black combat troops, admonishing the traditionalists for wanting to choose defeat just to spite blacks. They insist we should have Devers lead a recruitment campaign."
unionstate.3003.a:0 "We need black troops"
unionstate.3003.b:0 "We can not allow it"

unionstate.3004.t:0 "Minneapolis Syndicalists Strike!"
unionstate.3004.d:0 "While the state of Minnesota is in the control of the farmer-labor party, there remains a strong IWW element within Minneapolis whom have grown increasingly unstable since former governor Floyd Olson, whom held amicable relations with them, died. Now they are clearly desiring to join the CSA, and putting down their strikes would not only antagonize the socialists but cost us some manpower. Either we will have to pay them off of send national guard to quell them. Of course some radicals in the AFP would prefer to just give them semi-autonomy in part Minneapolis, allowing them to run it along more syndicalist lines so long as they do not attack members of the middle and upper class living there, and instead we will pay off business owners. They claim this will quell their anger altogether."
unionstate.3004.a:0 "Pay them off"
unionstate.3004.b:0 "Break them"
unionstate.3004.c:0 "Give them some autonomy"

unionstate.3005.t:0 "Silver Legion Grows"
unionstate.3005.d:0 "For conservatives who are dissapointed in the Democratic Party for their lack of populist credentials compared to other factions but who are also turned off by the AFP's and NPP's progressivism, the Silver Legion's mix of conservatism and wealth redistribution has become an increasingly attractive alternative. The Democrats are becoming increasingly unpopular among the farmers and 'legacy' democrats who supported them before and are increasingly a party of tradesmen and some middle-class iberals based largely out of Texas."
unionstate.3005.a:0 "Interesting"

unionstate.3006.t:0 "Leander Perez Controversy!"
unionstate.3006.d:0 "Leander Perez is an openly corrupt judge, hardline segregationalist and political boss operating out of Louisiana whom has made an alliance of pragmatism with Huey Long. Recently he has found himself in a controversy as journalists working for our political opponents have discovered his mishandling of oil leases under his watch, handing out contracts for bribes or to companies he ownes. Perez is a powerful ally but his handling of the oil contracts is forcing us to take a stand on this. Of course, this could be an opportunity to get rid of Perez, especially since in the future he will likely cause problems if we stray from his vision."
unionstate.3006.a:0 "Defend him"
unionstate.3006.b:0 "Have him step down"

unionstate.3007.t:0 "Perez Demands Compensation!"
unionstate.3007.d:0 "Perez is infuriated by our attempts to make him stand down! He is demanding that we compensate him for his work if we desire to maintain our current alliance, and has threatened us if we take legal action, claiming he has more than enough evidence to take Long down with him. What should we do?"
unionstate.3007.a:0 "Pay him off"
unionstate.3007.b:0 "Get rid of him"

unionstate.3008.t:0 "Leander Perez Kidnapped!"
unionstate.3008.d:0 "Leander Perez has recently disappeared after a falling out with Huey Long. According to reports, the fight was over his position as district attorney within Louisiana and his diversion of funds Long wanted to fund the war effort. He was apparently ambushed exiting a courthouse and entering his car, after which whomever was already in the car and the driver kidnapped him. Why his bodyguards did not intervene is unknown but while Long has blamed the dissappearance on socialists most don't doubt that Perez is in a swamp somewhere. With an example made, we could allow the machine he set up to go back to its usual business or we could appoint one of our own, which may be useful if we do not plan to follow the right-wing agenda of the Perez machine, with Cat Doucet being floated as an AFP representative who can take the plce of Perez and reform his machine to be more in-line with our values."
unionstate.3008.a:0 "Let the Machine do what it will"
unionstate.3008.b:0 "Cat Doucet should be rewarded for his loyalty"

### AFP Events ###

unionstate.34.t:0 "Fate of the wealthiest opponents"
unionstate.34.d:0 "The wealthiest American families whom aligned themselves with MacArthur such as Rockefeller and Morgan made a point to destroy Long so that they may end the notion of a wealth ceiling that would see them far less wealthy. Their gambled failed however, and while they have fled the nation we have taken control of their businesses left here in the states. For the large stockholders, we will have to decide if we should wholly take control of these businesses, and sell them to someone new, or allow them to retake control under new corporate leadership so long as they pay fines."
unionstate.34.a:0 "Repossess their property if found guilty"
unionstate.34.b:0 "Massive fines will do"

unionstate.35.t:0 "Smith Walks Out!"
unionstate.35.d:0 "Gerald L.K. Smith has finally had 'enough' of our shifting the party to the left and declared that he is formally joining the Christian Party, declaring us race traitors who are unwilling to stand against 'Jewish Power and syndicalist radicals'. He takes with him much of the right-wing of the AFP, leaving us more reliant on collecting former leftists to vote for us."
unionstate.35.a:0 "So be it"

unionstate.36.t:0 "Virgil Effinger killed!"
unionstate.36.d:0 "In a cabin in Tennessee, Virgil Effinger and 12 members of the Black Legion were killed today when they were tracked down by AFP Minutemen who opened fire on the cabin in the dead of night. The Black Legion has decied this as a war crime, claiming that Effinger was not only given no chance to surrender but that Black Legion watchmen were killed before they could issue a warning, meaning the Minutemen had no intention of giving them a chance to surrender. However the operation is being celebrated across America and Ranger Manuel T. Gonzaullas, whom lead the raid, is already being awared with medals as this will most assuredly kneecap the Black Legion."
unionstate.36.a:0 "Even more victories!"

unionstate.38.t:0 "Klan Clemency?"
unionstate.38.d:0 "With our decision to reconciliate the South old class we must decide how far to go in granting clemency to the Klan. Should we pardon lower-level members whom have take an oath of loyalty or simply force the American First Party in the South keep them in prison and try to keep Klan presence to a minimum, threatening them with retaliation if they go beyond talk."
unionstate.38.a:0 "Grant Clemency"
unionstate.38.b:0 "No, we can't let the Klan grow"

unionstate.39.t:0 "Southern Party Head"
unionstate.39.d:0 "The AFP has successfully expanded into the South using the old Democrat machines in the region for our own gain, but who should lead the organization in the deep south? There is Richard Russell Jr, who was a known moderate during the war and one of the more reluctant members of CAR, openly hoping they would shift closer to the center, however he is somewhat too socially conservative for many. Then there is James Eastland, who is more hardline on race issues but far more open to Long's economic agenda. Finally, we could pull some strings to place Earl Long in charge of the region."
unionstate.39.a:0 "Richard Russell Jr."
unionstate.39.b:0 "James Eastland"
unionstate.39.c:0 "Earl Long"

unionstate.40.t:0 "Black Share our Wealth Chapters Close"
unionstate.40.d:0 "Feeling betrayed by our decision to reconciliate with the Southern Democrats and push them aside politically speaking, many black Share Our Wealth clubs have shut down, most prominent being the one ran by Reverend J.H. Scott whom called Long a snake for betraying the same blacks who bled for him in favor of the opportunists who would have destroyed him just for political power, and said he would eventually turn on poor whites as well."
unionstate.40.a:0 "Damn!"

unionstate.41.t:0 "Dallas Klan Attacks Share Our Wealth!"
unionstate.41.d:0 "The Dallas Klan is known for having had a a more ambiguous relationship with the National Klan and did not outright side with the CAR, saving itself from the state crackdowns that destroyed or damaged other Klans in the American Union State. However, with our embrace of the black vote they seem to think they have made a mistake, and have vandalized a local Share Our Wealth club, followed by sending threatening letters to black reverends now embracing Huey Long. What should we do?"
unionstate.41.a:0 "Focus on them now"
unionstate.41.b:0 "We will deal with them later"

unionstate.42.t:0 "AFP Southern Leader"
unionstate.42.d:0 "As the AFP machine consumes the Southern Democrats and Old Democrats machines we will need to entrust a leader to oversee that our sympathizers, including black voters, are put on the voting rolls there. We could place longtime loyalist Rush Limbaugh Sr, who lead the AFP in the region throughout the war in the region, in charge. Another choice is Civil War veteran and AFP rising star Sid McMath. Finally, we could pull some strings to put Earl in charge."
unionstate.42.a:0 "Rush Limbaugh Sr."
unionstate.42.b:0 "Sid McMath"
unionstate.42.c:0 "Earl Long"

unionstate.43.t:0 "Old Democrats resist!"
unionstate.43.d:0 "The Old Democrats have seen a small revival among the Southern aristocracy that is resisting our attempts to absorb them, and funding local Klan chapters to attack us. While we can deal with them in time, damage is being done."
unionstate.43.a:0 "Damn!"

unionstate.44.t:0 "New Film: My First 100 Days!"
unionstate.44.d:0 "The newest political film out of Hollywood is proving to be a smashing success! My First One Hundred Days is a film about Huey Long's first 100 Days after winning the America Civil War and bringing peace and prosperity to the United States, as directed by Gregory La Cava. With an opening with the actual Huey Long endorsing the film and wishing all Americans well, critics claim that the film being funded by the AFP makes it little more than a piece of government propaganda. Nonetheless, it is popular with Americans looking for an optimistic view of the nation, a promise of unity and a leader who will protect them."
unionstate.44.a:0 "Very Good!"

unionstate.45.t:0 "Fate of Standard Oil"
unionstate.45.d:0 "With Standard Oil coming under our control, we have decided to keep the oil in Louisiana under government control. However the fate of the rest of our national reserves has come under debate, with some wanting us to break up Standard Oil into many companies and the US government simply owning a share of it while hardliners in the AFP would prefer if we just keep the oil nationalized and use the funds towards national projects."
unionstate.45.a:0 "Break it up"
unionstate.45.b:0 "Nationalize it"

unionstate.46.t:0 "Power of Congress"
unionstate.46.d:0 "Huey Long has made it clear that he will not leave the White House unless it's in a box, signing executive acts that expands his powers and declaring the AFP a government organization that is now virtually unchallengeable and has full control over voter rolls for the Presidential elections, with the army now lower ranking than the Minutemen politically speaking. Congress is another issue however, and some AFP members claim legitimate opposition should be allowed to exist there and in the Supreme Court. The Protect America Act put forward by hardliners and backed by the Louisiana machine and Townsend would effectively give the president full legislative and judicial power, and all him to remove troublesome congressmen from power, although this would drop all pretense of national democracy even if local elections and interaction with the government through town councils and party machines continue to exist."
unionstate.46.a:0 "Don't Pass the Act"
unionstate.46.b:0 "Pass the Act"

unionstate.47.t:0 "Protests throughout the Nation"
unionstate.47.d:0 "The Protect America Act has caused a wave of protests throughout the nation in opposition to Long's new status as America's presidential dictator. Civil liberties advocates in the ACLU have organized the largest protests in Louisiana and D.C. as both symbolize the wedding of the AFP machine with the American Government. The AFP inner circle believe light intimidation tactics such as scaring critical journalists will be enough, although Earl Long would prefer we just outright break up the protests through the national guard."
unionstate.47.a:0 "Intimidate the ACLU"
unionstate.47.b:0 "Shut down the protests"

unionstate.48.t:0 "The National Sensation of Share our Wealth Clubs"
unionstate.48.d:0 "Share our Wealth Clubs are quicky becoming as popular as church, with an increasing number of Americans using the clubs to not only to advocate for their political views but using them to coordinate group activists ranging from community service to poker days to bookstores. Because of this the National Share Our Wealth Society is requesting funds to increase their presence as it becomes an integral part of not just wealth redistribution but civic activities."
unionstate.48.a:0 "Of Course"
unionstate.48.b:0 "It Going Well As Is"

unionstate.49.t:0 "Archbishops seek support"
unionstate.49.d:0 "Perceving Long as a useful ally against both the Klan and socialists, many archbishops are coming around to Long's 'Distributionism' after previously being hostile to Charles Coughlin's influence among the Catholic population, with the most notable being Archbishop Edward Aloysius Mooney whom is now openly embracing Long's regime. Privately, the Archbishop desires increased funding for Catholic diocoses, for Long to endorse friendship with Catholic nations and for it to be easier to Catholic immigrants to become naturalized immigrants. However Coughlin supporters still in the AFP do not desire any such agreement, thinking Long should do it without their approval since they view the clericy with suspicion for not endorsing them sooner. However, the Archbishops promise increased support for Longism if he agrees."
unionstate.49.a:0 "Agree"
unionstate.49.b:0 "No, we are beholden to Catholic supporters not the Church"

unionstate.50.t:0 "Treasury Demands Capital Controls!"
unionstate.50.d:0 "As it becomes clear that Long is deadset on enacting his Share Our Wealth plans many are concerned that many amongst the wealthy, despite having just been saved from socialist revolution, will still attempt to flee the nation with their riches! ALready the treasury, IRS and interior ministry are reporting talk of moving out of the nation and are begging us to enact capital controls which would make it more difficult to leave the country. Two plans have been put forward, one that would set a limit on how much the wealthy can take abroad and another that would tax foreign investments and force those moving to a new country to pay a fee that absorb nearly all of their wealth behind, ensuring they most likely would not."

With the Vice-Presidency essentially being controlled by the AFP many want to simply select a new leader until the next election to help the nation heal from this loss, and there has been no shortage of infighting but the parties current position leaves only a handful able to take the position, with Earl Long competing with more ideological faction leaders for AFP and congressional support."

Many candidates have put themselves forward, including Long himself. His main opponents will be men like Gerald Smith and Sid McMath, but there are whispers that Long's own brother also wishes to take over. Allowing him to do so would allow the Long family to remain in power while also demonstrating Huey Long's willingness to give up power, even if it is conveniently to a family member. Of course, Huey Long could also be re-elected in a landslide, given his popularity in our nation. Who shall be our nominee?"

The Christian Party, serving as a popular party on the nation's right wing, is continuing its push for universal education and more funds for the Silver Rangers. The America First Party, having appeal across the spectrum, aims to continue the vision of Huey Long and implement more of the "Share the Wealth" program that Long has become famous for worldwide.

### Pelley Events ###

unionstate.52.t:0 "Fate of Murphy Ranch"
unionstate.52.d:0 "Now that our Legion reaches from coast to coast, we must revisit our place of final resort Pelley had planned out. In the outskirts of L.A, this compound was built a ranch to sustain the Silver Legion in case of a syndicalist victory. Murphy Ranch, as it is called, now has the ability to become fully operational. Should we continue to fortify the homestead to protect our new Californian brothers? Or should we convert the land into a workplace for our reborn American industry?"
unionstate.52.a:0 "Fortify it."
unionstate.52.b:0 "Convert it."

unionstate.53.t:0 "Can You See The Real Pelley?"
unionstate.53.d:0 "Although only known to the highest-ranking members of The Silver Legion, there is a hidden depth in the mind of our Chief Pelley. To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend. He is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now, a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one and the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well-accepted in this brave new American society, should we go public with some of his more... esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers, as it is, can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public at large. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"
unionstate.53.a:0 "Too many would fear this."
unionstate.53.b:0 "The world is ready."

unionstate.54.t:0 "Pelley Speech Attracts Controversy!"
unionstate.54.d:0 "During a controversial speech presidential candidate William Dudley Pelley endorsed what he has called the 'Ward System' for various groups labeled 'unproductive' which would ensure they do not receive full Commonwealth benefits until they are labeled as productive and would be relegated to largely labor jobs in the mean time. Naturally this has attracted a large amount of criticism while also appealing to former Democrats and racially conservative Republicans despite Pelley's claim the Ward System is 'radically different' from the ODP's Segregation platforms. Perhaps speaking out against it can increase our percent of the black and liberal votes, although it does threaten to drive away some voters."
unionstate.54.a:0 "Denounce the Speech"
unionstate.54.b:0 "Do nothing"

unionstate.55.t:0 "The Silver Cavalcade!"
unionstate.55.d:0 "With President Pelley having won a surprise electoral victory it has become clear that he needs to further his grassroots support if his most ambitious plans are to have any hope of succeeding. After several meetings with his advisors the President believes he has come up with the ideal plan for this, a nationwide barnstorming tour with members of the Christian Party and the Silver Legion. Seen live, broadcast both on radio and recorded to be shown after the fact, the Silver Cavalcade as it is now being called internally will surely spread our message further than ever before."
unionstate.55.a:0 "Fund it"
unionstate.55.b:0 "Actually, let's wait on this"

unionstate.56.t:0 "Jewish Segregation?"
unionstate.56.d:0 "As our platform is implemented more and more, one of the President's more controversial ideas has again reared its head. In Pelley’s mind the influence of the American Jewish population on both the capitalist and syndicalist systems and the growing population of politically aware Gentiles necessitates that they need to be stripped of certain rights for the time being, ostensibly for their own protection. Under the plan the Jewish population in each state would be moved to a single city until the Commonwealth system is fully implemented, at which time the President promises they will again receive full rights. Regardless of his promises though the idea has attracted outrage from a not insignificant portion of the population who claim it will lead to mass abuses and other rights violations, and on the other hand the hardliners in the Christian Party are demanding an immediate implementation of the plan. It seems like no matter what choice we make could cause us further problems in the future."
unionstate.56.a:0 "Implement it"
unionstate.56.b:0 "It's too controversial"

unionstate.57.t:0 "Our Problem Children"
unionstate.57.d:0 "In recent years the Christian Party has blossomed to become one of the largest in these United States, however this has not been without its own set of problems. Several elements of the Christian Party, particularly those in California, have taken their rhetoric far and beyond what the national leadership has. Led by Henry D. Allen's wing of the party as well as the increasingly controversial Gerald L.K. Smith it espouses radical racialist doctrines and promoting ideas such as the mass expulsion of Jews from the United States, these groups are increasingly harming the Presidents image and one way or another we need to make a choice on how to best handle the situation, with Willard Kemp offering to help reign them in via private conversations and threats of expulsion."
unionstate.57.a:0 "Do nothing"
unionstate.57.b:0 "Reign them in"

unionstate.58.t:0 "Slow growth of Soulcraft"
unionstate.58.d:0 "One of the more peculiar parts of President Pelley’s beliefs are his esoteric approach to Christianity. Known under several different names in prior years, Soulcraft Doctrine as it is now known has seen a slow but steady growth under the Pelley administration. Whilst the President has suspended any new publications on the matter to avoid First Amendment cases, prior works such as the Golden Scripts are being sold in higher numbers and more and more people seem open to exploring the President's ideas on not just politics and economics, but spirituality as well. Of course, this has also caused ridicule from papers such as the L.A. Times who mock Pelley as a 'guru', making many in the party reluctant to push the matter further."
unionstate.58.a:0 "Publish more Soulcraft"
unionstate.58.b:0 "A fine development"

unionstate.59.t:0 "Calling in Favors"
unionstate.59.d:0 "It is no secret that the President is the most powerful man in these United States, but even a powerful man at times has need for favors and assistance. In the years before he assumed the Presidency Pelley acquired a long list of contacts in several fields, particularly in finance, industry and politics, through his authorship followed by his leadership of the Silver Legion. Whilst our programs are being speedily implemented and the Chiefs vision of America becomes truer by the day it might be wise to call in these favors and outstanding debts, even if it might appear unpopular to the masses."
unionstate.59.a:0 "Of course"
unionstate.59.b:0 "No, it's corrupt"

unionstate.5900.t:0 "The Ward System"
unionstate.5900.d:0 "Due to his campaign promises, the Pelley administration is faced with a controversial idea that needs resolved. In the past, now President Pelley spoke of a system that in his eyes would allow the government to best help and uplift its most impoverished citizens. Known as the Ward System, the idea would see those Americans identified as most impoverished (particularly Appalachian whites, deep southern blacks and Mexican immigrants) become Wards of the state and be brought under its care. However, Pelley identifies these elements as the most unproductive in society and would deny them full Commonwealth benefits, relegating them to largely labor jobs. While in theory the system would be used to educate these peoples and ensure they can enter the Commonwealths workforce on an equal footing some have expressed outrage and compared the idea to modern slavery. The President calls these claims outrageous and a step forward from the old Jim Crow system but a choice must be made on the matter immediately, with challenges by ACLU and NAACP lawyers as well as the opposition parties making the mainstream of the CP more reluctant to endorse it."
unionstate.5900.a:0 "Implement the Wards"
unionstate.5900.b:0 "No, we should step back"

unionstate.5901.t:0 "Cleansing Hollywood"
unionstate.5901.d:0 "Before entering the realms of either spirituality or politics, Pelley was a rather successful screenwriter for Hollywood and while he eventually grew disgusted with the industry and its supposed Syndicalist influence he has always maintained a fondness for the silver screen, and in turn it began to despise him. Recently the President organized a showing of several of the films he helped make in his heyday at the White House and afterwards he announced a number of executive orders seeking to cleanse Hollywood of any anti-American sentiments and sponsoring the opening of new studios so that Americans may once again enjoy cinema if Hollywood did not 'clean up its act' at once. Much of the right-wing of the CP is pushing for him to simply implement these policies now however and Pelley would prefer it that way, although many in the cabinet view it as too radical."
unionstate.5901.a:0 "Clean up Hollywood"
unionstate.5901.b:0 "We'll give them a chance"

unionstate.5902.t:0 "The First Americans"
unionstate.5902.d:0 "Is there any group more disadvantaged and stepped on in the modern United States than its original inhabitants? President Pelley certainly doesn’t think that’s the case, having for several years written about the plights of various Indian groups and peoples and the attempts by various groups to seize their lands or turn them to beliefs like Syndicalism in an effort to manipulate them. In a recent speech to Congress the President swore that these transgressions would end now and forever, promising to strengthen and strongly enforce the treaties the Federal Government has with the Indian Nations and ensure these groups have equal opportunities under the Commonwealth system."
unionstate.5902.a:0 "It was needed"

### Texas-AFP Events ###
unionstate.5903.t:0 "Reaching out to Capital"
unionstate.5903.d:0 "One of Pappy O'Daniel's most ambitious desires is to bring the business community together with the poor farmers and workers he represents, and to find amicable compromises between all parties involved. Thus far, O'Daniel's attempts to reach out to big businesses both within the Union State and without have been met with failure. Businessmen have shown distaste for the faction representing the same populist values of men like William Jennings Bryan and "Fighting Bob" La Follette Sr., and O'Daniel will have to work hard to make such men feel comfortable in the country. To do so, we have a range of options. We could further cut taxes on businesses, encouraging them to come to Great Plains states, in particular Texas. However, such cuts may be unpopular with other parties and allow them to cut into our support base. We could also target certain industries, from finance to construction to the oil industry, in the hopes of increasing their interest in our country. This would be easier to accomplish, but will obviously benefit us less. What shall we do?"
unionstate.5903.a:0 "Move forward with business tax cuts"
unionstate.5903.b:0 "Encourage investment from finance"
unionstate.5903.c:0 "Promote construction investments and infrastructure"
unionstate.5903.e:0 "We can never go wrong with oil"

unionstate.5904.t:0 "O'Daniel's Five-Point Plan"
unionstate.5904.d:0 "Today, Pappy O'Daniel brought his plan for America's economic recovery to Congress. His five points include $40 million in new revenue, the abolition of the poll tax and of capital punishment, the appointment of a state-appointed budget director, and an amendment banning deficit spending. Though he was initially optimistic about the passage of the entire plan, it met some opposition from left-wingers in the AFP and the NPP who claimed that it was nowhere near enough to solve the current crisis. Further, while the Christian Party largely supported the proposals, Gerald K. Smith and other right-wing AFP members opposed the legislation, with some arguing it was too liberal and others arguing it went against everything Huey Long had fought for. As such, we may need to cut some of the proposals from the bill, but which proposals should be cut?"
unionstate.5904.a:0 "Cut the amendment to ban deficit spending"
unionstate.5904.b:0 "Remove the contentious proposal to raise new revenue"
unionstate.5904.c:0 "Get rid of the clause about capital punishment"

unionstate.5905.t:0 "The Debate over Pensions"
unionstate.5905.d:0 "One of O'Daniel's most persistent promises to his supporters was the implementation of old-age pensions for the nation's elderly population. As such, he has been eager to push this proposal and codify it into law, but it seems that his political inexperience has limited him in this pursuit. O'Daniel failed to even gain the support of some of his fellow Texan congressmen, with the questions of how this pension system will be funded still unclear. For his part, the Texan leader is apparently frustrated at this setback, but he pledges to carry on with his agenda nonetheless. Instead of an old-age pension system, he has instead begun to formulate a plan for post-war America, in which pensions will be granted to veterans as a way of easing the country, or more acurately, his fellow politicians, into the idea of pensions for all elderly citizens. This "Dependent and Disability Act" will be just what O'Daniel needs to push old-age pensions forward."
unionstate.5905.a:0 "Crooked politicians!"

unionstate.5906.t:0 "The Dependent and Disability Act Passes"
unionstate.5906.d.pappy:0 "The events of today were the culmination of years of planning on the part of W. Lee O'Daniel. Today, a form of O'Daniel's proposed pension program has been passed through Congress, and it is popular enough now that though he has largely abandoned any hope for pensions, his people cry out for them as a necessary form of relief. The most difficult part in passing the act was finding the source of funding for it, but due to his high popularity, he was able to force the implementation of a 1.6% tax on business transactions into law, providing more than enough funding for this program. O'Daniel does not plan to stop here, and in fact, he hopes to renew his push for elderly pensions as well. Time will tell whether this proposal succeeds, however."
unionstate.5906.d.other:0 "Today, the Dependent and Disability Act was officially codified into law. The successful passage of the act marks a victory for [TEX.GetLeader], who had helped push for this act as a way of thanking the patriotic veterans who made victory possible for the Union State. Now, veterans will get the relief they deserve."
unionstate.5906.a:0 "They deserve the money more than any!"

unionstate.5907.t:0 "Repay the Hillbilly Boys"
unionstate.5907.d:0 "Pappy O'Daniel's "Hillbilly Boy" band was instrumental in getting him elected as leader of the American Union State. Now, with his position secure, the members of the band expect some sort of reward for their loyalty, and O'Daniel is happy to give it to them. However, we must decide how we wish to go about this. We could grant them even more power in the government than they currently hold, meaning more positions for them in the cabinet. Alternatively, we could make them fabuously wealthy, and keep sending them on tours around the country. Do we need these men in government, or around the country?"
unionstate.5907.a:0 "Bring them home!"
unionstate.5907.b:0 "Send them out to boost morale!"

unionstate.5908.t:0 "Economy in Government"
unionstate.5908.d:0 "One of W. Lee O'Daniel's promises was to bring "economy to government". By this, he did not mean that the government would be more concerned with economic issues. Instead, he meant that the corrupt politicians in Texas, the Great Plains, and the country as a whole had used spending they promised to their people for their own gain or purposes, while the people suffered under their rule. One of the worst instances of this misuse was last week, when O'Daniel was informed that $1 million for oprhanages was instead being siphoned off to pay for party machine costs. Another instance was when $3 million meant to help buy new tanks apparently disappeared, and such instances are not uncommon. O'Daniel believes this wasteful spending to be distasteful, inefficient, and worst of all, immoral. However, to get the spending of our government officials back on track, should we..."
unionstate.5908.a:0 "Make sure the military is efficient"
unionstate.5908.b:0 "Hold politicians to their promises" 

unionstate.5909.t:0 "Tax Law Controversy"
unionstate.5909.d:0 "From the very beginnings of his political career, Pappy O'Daniel has had a desire to slice taxes for his people and give them the ability to spend again. However, he has met significant opposition from the left in this endeavor. Mainstream Longists have protested that such cuts, particularly on the wealthy, would go against the ideals of Huey Long. Meanwhile, those in the NPP argue that these tax cuts are merely an excuse to make the Union State more attractive to wealthy investors. O'Daniel has not denied this charge, happy to admit that he wants more investment in Texas and the country as a whole, and he has even shot back that anyone who does not want such investment is as bad as the politicians who got us into this crisis to begin with. \n\nRhetoric aside, though, it is apparent that O'Daniel will have a hard time forcing his ideal tax laws through without tweaking them. Should we decide to cut poll taxes, we will surely gain the support of leftists and the common people, while slicing taxes on businesses will likely bring more investment in our economy, regardless of the state of the nation's politics or military."
unionstate.5909.a:0 "Cut poll taxes!"
unionstate.5909.b:0 "Tax relief for businesses!"

unionstate.5910.t:0 "An Opportunity Arises!"
unionstate.5910.d:0 "With the war over and O'Daniel's programs beginning to win the hearts and minds of Americans, it is a better time than ever to attempt to push for the fifth part of O'Daniel's five-point plan. It may seem like a minor detail to some, including O'Daniel himself, but his supporters will hold him to it. If we can push this legislation through Congress, O'Daniel will be remembered for both reconstruction and his own plans. Should we move forward with this policy?"
unionstate.5910.a:0 "Yes, do it!"
unionstate.5910.b:0 "There is no need..."

unionstate.5911.t:0 "Our National Flag"
unionstate.5911.d:0 "With Pappy O'Daniel in charge of the country, it may be high time for a new flag. There are many possibilities in consideration, with all of them having one form or another of Texan influence to them. On the other hand, we could keep our current flag. What should we do?"
unionstate.5911.a:0 "A Yellow Star Flag"
unionstate.5911.b:0 "A Liberty or Death Flag"
unionstate.5911.c:0 "A Come and Take It Flag"
unionstate.5911.e:0 "A More Traditional Flag"
unionstate.5911.f:0 "Keep Our Current Flag"

unionstate.5912.t:0 "Collected Western Stories of Robert E. Howard"
unionstate.5912.d:0 "The current revival of American culture has been followed by the renaissance of Westerns as a genre of literature. One interesting case of this is a collection of short stories by Texas writer R. E. Howard, which have just been released. These stories, like 'The Pride of Bear Creek' or 'Pistol Politics', focus on describing adventurous life in the American Frontier. Stories about gunslingers such as the Sonora Kid are especially popular in this genre, appealing to a wide swath of readers. This does not mean, however, that the author wrote Western stories only in this narrowly understood subgenre. Literary works such as the adventures of the Texan traveler Francis Xavier Gordon in 'The Coming of El Borak', 'Hawk of the Hills' or 'The Country of the Knife' or even horrors stories such as 'Black Canaan'  or 'Pigeons from Hell' are all part of the Western genre, even if they are less traditional. Meanwhile, the popularity of Howard's Westerns is now so great that no one remembers the rest of the literary attempts to create other pulp heroes, such as the boring Conan the Barbarian or the naive puritan Solomon Kane."
unionstate.5912.a:0 "Robert E. Howard will be remembered as the Father of Westerns"


unionstate.5913.t:0 "Racial Segregation in Trade Unions"
unionstate.5913.d:0 "Until recently, the demands of some trade unions were too far-reaching. Postulates of non-American and non-Christian initiatives, probably inspired by immigrant conspirators from syndicalist Europe, are not only a threat to American values but also harmful to the entire economic system. These includes issues such as desegregation in workplaces or the equalization of wages of White and Colored workers. The abolition of the unions would, of course, be harmful, as it would leave workers vulnerable to crooked politicians. A promising solution to this problem was proposed as early as 1924, by the unionist Samuel Gompers. He claimed that 'the Caucasians are not going to let their standard of living be destroyed by Negroes, Chinamen, Japs, or any other…. If the colored man continues to lend himself to the work of tearing down what the White man has built up, a race hatred worse than any ever known before will result.' For this reason, he suggested creating separate trade unions only for White Americans. Keeping blacks from joining trade unions would increase the influence of Whites in the government by strengthening the power of the workers' strike. Interestingly, even the extremist William Z. Foster had such remarks in the past. In 1920 he called blacks 'a race of strikebreakers'. So a firm decision must be made. Will we maintain segregation in the new trade unions or allow racially mixed unions to function?"
unionstate.5913.a:0 "Compulsory racial segregation in trade unions is the right thing to do"
unionstate.5913.b:0 "We will not restrict the freedom of association"


unionstate.5914.t:0 "Curriculum at American Universities"
unionstate.5914.d:0 "Universities are forging our young minds. As such, they are an important institution for the next generation. However, academics in our country must not be infected with anti-American or subversive thought. Some academics in fields such as social sciences, anthropology and the humanities have been known to transmit progressive and even harmful ideas to their students. Some even see a sinister influence in fields such as modern physics or biological sciences. The simple fact is that free and uncontrolled universities can become hotspots for subversive thought under the pretext of academic freedom. To combat this, Pappy O'Daniel plans to put favorable representatives on the Universities Regents Councils to control what is taught. Although some criticize this project, others, including Coke Stevenson, even encouraged more radical action including the removal of defiant professors."
unionstate.5914.a:0 "Let us introduce trusted people to university authorities"
unionstate.5914.b:0 "No, academic freedom must not be violated"

### Progressive Events ###

unionstate.60.d:0 "Black Legion leader Virgil Effinger has been captured by our forces after the military uncovered his hideout and forced him and his bodyguards to surrender. Now, Effinger and his top men are going to be tried by our government but the attorney general is asking us if we should pursue the death penalty or not? While some activists in our ranks would prefer to stick to our anti-death penalty stance most everyone else believes we should favor the death penalty. Since Effinger will absolutely be convicted this will decide his fate."
unionstate.60.a:0 "Pursue the Death Penalty"

unionstate.61.d:0 "With the Plumb Plan being enacted [TEX.GetLeader] cut the red tape on the ATSF railway in Wisconsin to symbolize a new railroad that is run by both the owners, workers and public. While initially costly to implement this is a widely popular event and has seen many Americans looking forward to a new America, and many unions among affected railroads viewing liberal reforms as superior to syndicalist policy."
unionstate.61.a:0 "Great"

unionstate.62.t:0 "Endorse Deweyism?"
unionstate.62.d:0 "John Dewey was a member of the social patriots in the CSA but who was sympathetic to us and repeatedly pushed for peace with the American Union State, and many of his adherents were among our own ranks as well. As such, his followers believe we should take the opportunity of refitting the education system to apply his theories of hands off teaching and self-learning to our schools, which they believe will better prepare our children to become citizens. Traditional teachers of course oppose the model."
unionstate.62.a:0 "Stick to old methods"
unionstate.62.b:0 "Embrace Deweyism"

unionstate.63.t:0 "Long criticizes the NPP!"
unionstate.63.d:0 "Huey Long has come out against 'sewer socialism', arguing that it does not go far enough to redistribute wealth while also leaving too much power in bureaucrats who do not represent the 'will of the people'. We have replied with accusations of Long's corruption but he has struck a chord among those who believe Long would have gone further to combat economic inequality although our economists believe it would have been for show."
unionstate.63.a:0 "Bastard!"

unionstate.64.t:0 "Black Support?"
unionstate.64.d:0 "The NAACP is petitioning us to make an effort to support black workers by removing racical barriers in being hired for our government programs and organizing them within our farmer-labor groupings. This has naturally caused ambivalance in the party despite many progressives favoring such measures, some are still nervous this could lead to a backlash and note that our black support during the election was not particularly high anyways."
unionstate.64.a:0 "Work with the NAACP"
unionstate.64.b:0 "We're not ready for that"

unionstate.65.t:0 "NPP absorbs the Farmer-Labor Party"
unionstate.65.d:0 "Concluding our negotiations with the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party and its leaders such as Elmer Austin Benson we have managed to finally make the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party a wing of the National Progressive Party! Shall we keep them a semi-autonomous force or push for them to be fully absorbed into the NPP?"
unionstate.65.a:0 "Absorb them"
unionstate.65.b:0 "Leave them some autonomy"

unionstate.66.t:0 "Large Contractors Offer Help"
unionstate.66.d:0 "While we promised to favor smaller contractors for our projects, the Kiewit Corporation has just made a very lucrative offer to help rebuilding Nebraska alongside our government. This would be much more efficient and quick than assembling many small contractors, and would see the state back on its feet in no time. However, Nebraska contractors would of course see this as a betrayal, even if we tried to have Kiewit work with them."

unionstate.77.t:0 "Share Our Wealth Appoints Smith"
unionstate.77.d:0 "An impromptu meeting has been held among the board members of the Share Our Wealth program. The organisation's shareholders consist of members of the AFP, the Prohibiton Party, and the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. These board members met at 2am, straddling the line between official business and secrecy. William Upshaw, of the Prohibtion Party, brought to the fore President Long's apparent betrayal of his party values. The AFP board members agreed that Long's rejection of a main campaign promise bodes ill for more 'morally-centred' legislation in the future. Francis Townsend, who joined Huey Long in order to push his Old-Age Revolving Pension Plan, agreed it was necessary to elect a new representative for the Share Our Wealth program, someone who wouldn't be beholden to the president's whims. After much debate, it was decided that newly-elected Louisiana Congressman, Gerald L.K. Smith, is far enough removed from Long yet still dedicated to social security. As the votes were tallied in Smith's favour, the board pondered what Smith's association with the Silver Legion might mean in the future..."

unionstate.78.t:0 "Dixiecrats Declare AFP Corrupt"
unionstate.78.d:0 "After the end of hostilities in Washington, a large section of the conservative Democratic Party pledged their alligence to [Root.GetNameDef] and to the ideals President Long follows. Implicitly, these Democrats hoped Long would fulfil their desires for more state power in exchange for allowing Long's economic reforms to easily pass. This unwritten promise was broken when Long denied them the ability to enforce Prohibition, going so far as to ignore their impassioned speeches in favour of repealing the Interstate Commerce Act. Many conservative Democrats now see the AFP's regime as merely a sham democracy that rejects any measure the Long political machine will not personally benefit from. The President was still shocked, however, when the halls of Congress were only 3/4 full this week. Currently legislation is frozen, and it appears the so-called Dixiecrats are taking all their vacation days at once."
unionstate.78.a:0 "Fools, we are their only home."

unionstate.79.t:0 "The Officers' Revolt"
unionstate.79.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to incentivise officers to remain in their positions during this very sensivite time, approximately one hundred army officers have expressed deep reservations for Huey Long's trial. The press has reported these dissenting opinions, and thus have also given us warning of the officers' coming protest in the capital in five day's time. We have no illusions these marchers will be peaceful, or that their march won't culminate in a demand for the Silver Legion to return power to the AFP. General Patton, still leading the Fifth Army, has promised he will protect our right to rule the Commonwealth. Giving him free reign against the marchers, however, will be a bloody battle that could easily backfire on us. Richard Butler has suggested instead having Legion supporters infiltrate the marcher ranks and disrupt them from within. Better to make the officers look unreasonable and foolish than to make the government appear tyrannical."

unionstate.80.t:0 "Rebuilding the Constitution"
unionstate.80.d:0 "The Dixiecrats, who we tipped off about the 'arrest' of Long, have been useful in maintaining the facade that is Congress. The tedious proccess of replacing state representatives with Legionaries has meant that we have become more and more reliant on the Dixiecrats remaining content in the meantime. After a recent push by Chief Pelley to pass Amendments 22-24, bringing in a new "Grandfather" clause -depriving people of rights not enjoyed by their grandfather- and requiring a profession of faith in order to serve in Congress, the agenda has turned to Pelley's final amendment: reserving private and government land for redistribution to Christians. This has spawned a surprise backlash. The Dixiecrats claim this eminent domain impedes the rights of states to their own land, something Huey Long promised he wouldn't do. Chief Pelley is now in a bind. If he gives into the Dixiecrats, it will make him look weak at the very time he needs to look like he has all the answers. If he strongarms the amendment, as many of his advisers suggest, it dispels the illusion of democracy we so dearly need to maintain."

### Military Research ###
unionstate.101.t:0 "The Future of Warfare"
unionstate.101.d:0 "After a long reshuffling of former US departments, the American Union State has uncovered old classified weapons proposals. The two proposals that caught the most interest are ones authored by Robert Goddard and Vannevar Bush, each proposing an expensive weapon project to deter invasions. Fortunately, both men were recovered from their respective hiding places, and persuaded into updating their proposals. Goddard's plan is for a liquid fuel rocket to deliver stable explosive payloads across long distances. Vannevar Bush's is a theoretical utilisation of nuclear fission to create a bomb based on experiments done in Europe. Which plan should we pursue?"

unionstate.102.d:0 "After months of testing in the Southwest, and publishing several classified papers, the first test launch is prepared. In a fenced off area outside White Sands, New Mexico, Goddard's rocket stands ready. The rocket's design incorporates liquid fuel and stabilizers devised by Goddard with flight mechanics devised by Lindbergh Aircraft. At the head is a lower tonnage explosive meant to detonate after a set amount of time spent flying. A successful arc and explosion turns the New Mexico skyline on fire."
unionstate.102.a:0 "Nowhere is Safe."

unionstate.103.t:0 "Nuclear Power in New Mexico"
unionstate.103.d:0 "Hurdle after hurdle stood in between the American Union State and atomic weaponry. It began with a dearth of willing physicists and nuclear experts including Robert Oppenheimer who has yet to be located. Several other potential candidates signed a Humanist Declaration of pacifism abroad declaring their opposition to our program. Therefore, Bush has had to resort to industrial technicians which extended the timeline. Finally, after much testing and assistance from George Kistiakowsky, the first atomic bomb is tested. Due to the extensive safety precautions take, the vital test yielded an impressive blast but poor documentation."

unionstate.104.t:0 "America is United"
unionstate.104.d:0 "At long last America has been united under [Root.GetNameDef]'s banner. Traitors and would-be tyrants have tried to destroy and corrupt this great nation, yet we held firm and took control. A question has arisen, however, in those territories which did not initially rise up with Huey Long in the civil war: is this country the United States of America, or is it truly [Root.GetNameDef]? There is a longing among many to return to the stability of the Stars and Stripes, even if things have irrevocably changed. Should we appease them and show that the America Huey originally envisioned still exists?"

unionstate.151.t:0 "The Second Declaration of Independence"
unionstate.151.d:0 "While many of the southern governors were in favour of drafting a new constitution on the spot, the urge to emulate the original rebellion against the British monarchy prevailed. A second Declaration of Independence was drafted in Baton Rouge over the course of a few days, painstakingly emulating the original conceit of the American Revolution. This declaration outlined the lack of protection the federal government gave to citizens, and the role of the state to protect the welfare of the poor. The signatories declare that it is within their constitutional right to organize a militia against tyranny, and that the federal government's deadline should not only be ignored it must be defied."
unionstate.151.a:0 "Annuit coeptis."

unionstate.152.t:0 "The American Union State Congress Convenes"
unionstate.152.d:0 "Through the grapevine, dozens of congressmen have heard of Huey Long's assembly in Baton Rouge. Some came to wish Long well and stayed, others simply to court favour with the revolution. These meetings in Baton Rouge began to take on a Congressional appearance, with Coughlin standing as the President of the attending senators. Many notable figures were in attendance, such as Texas Governor James Allred, Alabama Governor Bibb Graves, Wisconsin Governor Philip LaFollete and his brother Senator Robert LaFollete Jr. along with many other representatives from other loyal states. Aware of the growing determination to defy the federal government, and that this lack of willingness to negotiate meant civil war was all but certain, a large number of politicians have slinked away to the west... though those that remain seem more determined than ever to see victory."
unionstate.152.a:0 "They'll get theirs!"

unionstate.153.t:0 "Deadline Looms"
unionstate.153.d:0 "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Across the part of the country controlled by Long's supporters, an army formed of militia and the Minutemen has been raised and a growing determination to see the country remade by force has taken hold. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they no longer see a path to compromise."

unionstate.158.d:0 "The American Union State has sent an embassy stating that they have no intention of fighting us or protecting the European imperial powers that have aims on the Americas, offering us a non-aggression pact in which we mutually agree not to interfere with one another. Some are surprised by this given their non-socialist nature although it is consistent with their isolationism.

TEX_CLAIRE_LEE_CHENNAULT_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 6, 1890, in Commerce, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Claire Lee 'Old Leatherface' Chennault began his military career when he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps while he attended the Louisiana State University. He graduated from the Officers' School at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana in 1917, and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the Army Signal Corps soon after. He earned his wings in 1919 and remained in service after the air branch was turned into the Air Corps. In 1931, he became Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School, and would take charge of the 1st Pursuit Group of Alabama's Aerobatic Team, becoming a regional celebrity of his aerial feats. As 1937 loomed over, Chennault was considering resignation as the staff in Washington refused to promote him beyond Captain, considering him unfit for duty due to his declining health. When the American Civil War began, Chennault sided with the former Governor of Louisiana, giving Huey a small hike in recruitment as passionate observers of Chennault's performances filled the recruiting booths, and in exchange, Huey granted Chennault the honorary rank of Brigadier General for his service to the American Union State\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His health has been slowly deteriorating, with deafness and chronic bronchitis being the main issues Chennault will have to face sooner or later."
TEX_DADDY_COLLINS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joseph Lawton 'Lightning Joe' Collins began his military career in 1913 when he joined West Point thanks to an alternate appointment his uncle Martin Behrman, the major of New Orleans at the time, managed to get him at the age of 17 and graduated as an infantry second lieutenant in 1917. He'd stay as a teacher in West Point and marry Gladys Easterbrook in his time at the academy. In 1921, he began teaching Chemistry in West Point as well and in 1926, he graduated from the company officer course at the Infantry School in Fort Benning. A year later, he'd undergo and successfully complete an advanced course at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. After that, Collins taught weapons and tactics at the Infantry School from 1927 to 1932 where he requested a transfer to the Philippine Division from 1933 to 1934 and became a major. In 1935 and 1936, he graduated from Army Industrial College and the Army War College reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. \n§YImportant Notes:§W- An extremely talented yet aggressive commanding officer, his skills shine the most when leading an attack on the enemy rather than playing on the defence."
TEX_COURTNEY_HODGES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 05 January, 1887, in Houston County, Georgia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Courtney Hicks Hodges began his military career when he joined West Point in 1904, but was forced to drop out a year later due to his extremely poor academic performance. Undeterred, he enlisted in the army in 1906 as a private, where he quickly rose to the rank of sergeant in 1907 and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in 1909. He joined Pershing during the Punitive Expedition, where he met George S. Patton and George Marshall, and would remain in the Mexican border for the rest of the late 1910s, facing off several small skirmisher groups with the 6th Infantry Regiment. After being promoted to Major for his service at the border, he attended the Command and General Staff College, graduating in 1925 and becoming a member of the Infantry Board at Fort Benning. In 1934, graduated from the Army War College, earning him his promotion to lieutenant colonel."
TEX_WILLIAM_SIMPSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 18, 1888, at Weatherford, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W In June 1905, a month after turning 17, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated four years later in June 1909, being commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Infantry Branch. Simpson's first assignment was with the 6th Infantry Regiment at Fort Lincoln, North Dakota. Soon afterwards the regiment was sent overseas to Mindanao, in the Philippines, in January 1910 and remained there for another two-and-a-half years, where Simpson participated in the suppression of the Moro Rebellion. He returned to the United States with his regiment in 1912 and, being stationed at Fort Bliss, remained there as a company commander until, now promoted to first lieutenant, he fought in Pershing's Punitive Expedition in 1916. In February 1917 he became aide-de-camp to Major General George Bell, Jr., who commanded the El Paso Military District. Since 1919, Simpson has filled several staff appointments and attended military schools and courses and would be promoted in early 1921 to Captain. Simpson served with the General Staff until 1932 where he began teaching military science and tactics at Pomona College until 1936, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1934. As the country spiralled out of control, Simpson became more and more aligned with Huey Long's vision of America as time passed, and when Huey finally proclaimed the American Union State, Simpson presented his services to what he sees as the true American government. For his loyalty, Simpson was turned into a brigadier general."
TEX_JACOB_DENVERS_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 8 September 1887, in York, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Devers began his military career when Congressman Daniel F. Lafean offered him an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1906 and graduated on 11 June 1909 as an artillery second lieutenant. Devers' first posting was to the 1st Battalion, 4th Mountain Artillery in Washington and for his next assignment in late 1912, Devers was sent back to West Point to teach mathematics. On 1 April 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and he was transferred to the newly activated 9th Field Artillery at the Schofield Barracks in Hawaii and promoted to Captain in early 1917. In May 1919, Devers was sent on a three-month temporary duty assignment to study the Weltkrieg in Europe. He attended the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin to study the equipment and tactics used by both sides during the Weltkrieg. He was promoted to major on 1920 and he was later selected to attend the Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1925. He was then posted to Fort Sill as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929 where Devers was transferred to Washington, D.C., to serve on the staff of the Chief of Field Artillery. In 1932, he was chosen to attend the Army War College and graduated on June 1933. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 26 February 1934. With the country spiraling into Civil War, Devers found himself fighting more and more against his superiors inability to react to internal issues, starting a deep rivalry between him and Dwight Eisenhower, even putting him at odds with his old friend Leslie McNair. When Huey Long declared the Union State, Devers decided that MacArthur and his staff was a liability for America, and promptly volunteered for the AUS officer corp, where he was promoted to Field Marshal along with Terry De La Mesa Sr."
TEX_TERRY_DE_LA_MESA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 1 April 1888, in Fort Douglas, Utah, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Allen was born into a family with a long tradition of military service. His grandfater, Colonel Carlos Alvarez de la Mesa, was a Spanish immigrant who fought for the Union in the Civil War. His father, Colonel Samuel Allen, also served in the military. In 1907, Allen was appointed to West Point in New York. Eventually, this would end in failure primarily due to a stutter, and Allen was kicked out of the school. However, after a successful education at the Catholic University of America, he got a second chance at a military career, and become a second lieutenant of the U.S. Cavalry assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia. Over the years, he has slowly climbed the ranks, and a freak accident that saw him shot in the jaw caused his stutter to disappear. While moving up the chain of command, Allen continued his military education at various institutions, from the U.S. Army Cavalry School and U.S. Army Command School, both in Kansas, to the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He would continue his career as an instructor and eventually met George C. Marshall Jr., who promoted him to the rank of brigadier general. Though he skipped the rank of Colonel that his familial predecessors had had, he did not mind, his focus being on the battlefield first and foremost. In fact, many have compared him to General George S. Patton in his approach to warfare, as his aggressive style and colorful style make him very similar to the more famous man. However, the two differ outside of those factors, as Allen cares little for his appearance and more for tactics, emphasizing night assaults and unpredictable plans. His confident, efficient style of leadership has given him one of the most promising careers in the U.S. Army. Or it did, until 1936, when Major General Omar Bradley clashed with Allen and caused Allen to flee west to the familiar state of Texas, where he had met his wife and served some of his first years of military service. There, he joined Huey Long's cause, and Long, recognizing his talent and high rank, immediately promoted him to the rank of Field Marshal alongside Jacob Denvers."
TEX_MATTHEW_RIDGWAY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 3, 1895, in Fort Monroe, Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Matthew Bunker 'Old Iron Tits' Ridgway began his military career in 1913 when he successfully passed the entrance exam to West Point after failing the year prior. He graduated from the academy in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. Ridgway was first assigned to patrol duty in the Mexican border with the 3rd Infantry Regiment, where he reached the rank of Captain and would return to West Point in 1920 as a Spanish teacher. In 1925, Ridgway graduated from the United States Army Infantry School, after which he was sent to the American Legation in Tianjin and later sent to Nicaragua, where he was one of the American COs trying to supervise the 1927 elections. In 1930, he'd be transferred to the Philippines, where he became an advisor to the Governor-General of the islands and would return to America in 1933 as a Major. He'd graduate from the Army Command and General Staff School in 1935 and was attending the Army War College in Pennsylvania before the Civil War broke out. With the ever increasing radicalisation, he found himself being harassed several times by 'workers' militias' and slowly began losing faith in the Federal Government. When Huey Long finally proclaimed the American Union State, Ridgway decided it was best to leave for the AUS if that was necessary to save America from anarchy, where he was promoted to Brigadier General."

After fulfilling a series of staff roles, mainly in Wyoming and Texas, he found himself strongly advocating for the mechanization of the American Army along with Patton, which due to the army budget cuts, it became nothing more than a pipe dream for them."
TEX_CLIFTON_CATES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 31, 1893, in Tiptonville, Tennessee, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Clifton Bledsoe 'Lucky' Cates began his military career after graduating from the Missouri Military Academy in 1910 as a second lieutenant for the Marine Corps Reserves. His excellent performance in drills and his qualifications caught the attention of the then Brigadier General George Barnett, who took Cates as his aide-de-camp. Cates would serve with Barnett until 1923, where Cates, who was now a Captain, was assigned to command the Marine detachment in the USS Arizona. In 1928, he was transferred to the to the 4th Marine Regiment in San Diego which would be transferred to guard the American Legation in Shanghai. He returned to America in 1932, where he signed up for the Army Industrial College and the Senior Officer Course of the Marine Corps, graduating in 1935 and reaching the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He'd return to Shanghai in 1936, but would take his leave in late March 1937. As the country spiraled into Civil War, Cates was visiting his family in Tennessee. Seeing the chaos in his hometown, which had been ravaged by a fire when he was young, Cates decided to join the American Union State and convinced his colleague Lewis Puller to join him, becoming a Brigadier General for the AUS Marine Corps, and along with 'Chesty' Puller, one of the most important Marine commanders of the American Union State."

Until he became 21, he decided to study in the Virginia Military Institute, and after graduating in 1919, he attended the non-commissioned officer school and Officer Candidates School of the Marine Corps, earning the rank of second lieutenant. In 1921, he was assigned to the Gendarmerie d'Haiti and would see over forty skirmishes fighting the Caco rebels and becoming adjutant to Alexander Vandegrift. After four years of serving in garrison duty in the United States, he'd be assigned to the Marine detachment in the Nicaraguan National Guard in December 1928. In Nicaragua, he led several engagements against the Sandinista forces, where he was able to prevail despite being outnumbered significantly by the Nicaraguan rebels, and earning the Navy Cross medal. He returned to the United States in 1931, and completed the Company Officers Course at Fort Benning which he had left pending in 1928, graduating in June 1932 as a Captain and returning to Nicaragua in September. There, he took part in the Battle of El Sauce, where he earned his promotion to Major. He'd be then transferred to command the 'China Marines' in Shanghai in 1933 and would return to America in June 1936 to serve as an as an instructor at The Basic School. With the nation spiralling into Civil War, Puller was persuaded by Cates to join the American Civil War as Puller was indecisive as to who to support. With his arrival at Louisiana, Puller's actions in Nicaragua and Haiti had earned the respect of many members of the staff and Huey Long's cabinet, who pushed for his promotion to Brigadier General."
