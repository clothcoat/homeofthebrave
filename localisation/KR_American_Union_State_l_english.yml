### Parties ###
TEX_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
TEX_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America -  The SPA operating in our territory is loyal to the IWW in the CSA, and our relations with them are largely dictated by our relations with them. Nonetheless, machine politics, propaganda and the use of populism to absorb many of their potential voters has left them without a chance of being elected in our region."
TEX_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
TEX_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - The SPA operating in our territory is loyal to the IWW in the CSA, and our relations with them are largely dictated by our relations with them. Nonetheless, machine politics, propaganda and the use of populism to absorb many of their potential voters has left them without a chance of being elected in our region."
TEX_radical_socialist_party:0 "Independent League"
TEX_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Independent League - An association aligned with the Social Patriots in the CSA, these radicals are aligned with radical farm groups and seek a class collaborative form of socialism."
TEX_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
TEX_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party - Most of the former progressive Republicans have ended up in the Progressive Party which ran before the Civil War. Without a national organ to draw from, the National Progressives are gradually absorbing them and making them a sub-wing of their organization."
TEX_social_liberal_party:0 "National Progressive Party"
TEX_social_liberal_party_long:0 "National Progressive Party - Part of the Republican Party has collapsed into the National Progressive Party, a creation of the Wisconsin-based La Follete family and one of the few major challengers to Long's agenda, with the party claiming to be more progressive than populist."
TEX_market_liberal_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The liberal democrats in the region desire a reunion with the pro-democratic factions of America at once if possible, only agreeing to work with the AUS to stop more radical factions. That said they do pay more lip service to farmers relative to other wings of the liberal democrats throughout the nation."
TEX_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party in the region that operates legally have often had to made concessions to populist rhetoric but in practice largely work with the AUS out of fear of the Old Democrats, non-local big business and Socialists. Supportive of segregation, their support would likely wane if lip service was paid to race progressives."
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The America First Party is a populist-American broad tent made up of those who follow a laborist, patriotic ideology and also generally view left socialism as being unpatriotic or totalitarian. They stand in opposition to other progressives by their reliance on political machines, their Share the Wealth Plan, relative cultural conservatism, populist-messaging, party militias and, more than anything, their personalism based around Louisiana Governor and firebrand Huey Long. As such they preach an odd mixture of radicalism, populism and pragmatism in order to enact a pro-labor and pro-famer capitalist nation united around the American identity."
TEX_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The Radicals of the AFP view traditional voting as inadequate to the American people due to the influence of large corporations and banks, and believe a presidential dictatorship enveloped in populism would better represent the will of the American people."
TEX_national_populist_party:0 "White Leagues"
TEX_national_populist_party_long:0 "White Leagues - The various White Leagues in our territory are unorganized paramilitary organizations cut off the central apparatus of the National Democratic White League. While some have chosen not to take an official side during the war, the vast majority have sympathies with the CAR. Some AUS activists believe we could appeal to them to stop them from actively attacking us while other would see them finished."

TEX_progressive_AFP_social_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_progressive_AFP_social_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is progressive-populism which defends and even seeks to enact further welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race moderation or progressivism in favor of strong civic nationalism."
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_liberal_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_liberal_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is liberal populism which defends and even seeks to enact further welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race moderation in favor of strong civic nationalism."
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_conservative_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_conservative_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is conservative populism which defends welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race conservatism."

TEX_christian_party:0 "Christian Party"
TEX_christian_party_long:0 "Christian Party - The official political-wing of the Silver Legion of America and a creation of William Dudley Pelley, the CP has largely absorbed both conservative populists and former democrats in the religious nationalist party. United by populist proposals of patriotism, universal employment and a minimum income for full citizens, the CP differs from the AFP and NPP in the emphasis on its military wing, Pelley's writings, harsher attitude towards socialism, citizen referendums, more explicitly Christian-based welfare, stricter constitutionalism, cultural supremacism (including overt anti-Semitism), and Pelley's ward policy towards groups of people he views as unproductive. As such the group is unsurprisingly extremely divisive even with the populist AUS, not helped by its even more radical-wing of the party being even more overtly racialist as well openly authoritarian, with many unsure how far Pelley would go to appease them."
TEX_christian_party_auth:0 "Christian Party"
TEX_christian_party_auth_long:0 "Christian Party - The official political-wing of the Silver Legion of America and a creation of William Dudley Pelley, the CP has largely absorbed both conservative populists and former democrats in the religious nationalist party.

TEX_root_out_out_traitors_desc:0 "Despite their armies being defeated extremists still populate the American states we have brought justice to.

TEX_reconcile_the_left:0 "Reconcile the Left"
TEX_reconcile_the_left_desc:0 "We can never excuse the CSA's attempt to overthrow the American Constitution or their anti-American syndicalism but the grievances of the workers that were fooled into supporting them are fair. We should appeal to the Independent Leagues and AFL whom desire economic reform, knowing they wanted to make peace with Huey but were prevented from doing so by the most extreme radicals we will now bleed support from."
TEX_afp_alone:0 "AFP Alone"
TEX_afp_alone_desc:0 "Compromise. That was the word used by useless politicians whom nearly handed our country over to extremists. The AFP and the nation more generally is not going to go out of its way to appeal to any of the factions that aligned themselves against the AUS. If they want, let them repent and embrace Longist values on their own but we will not compromise."
TEX_reconcile_the_right:0 "Reconcile the Right"
TEX_reconcile_the_right_desc:0 "There is no mistake that the political right made mistakes in supporting either the Feds or Murray. However their pro-American values and defense of capitalism against socialism is admirable and their machines are too large to hit head on, we should co-opt them with appeals to the cultural conservatives and anti-socialist populism, opening the way to taking the South."
TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats:0 "Dismantle the Dixiecrats"
TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats_desc:0 "The right-wing Democrats have looked down on Huey since he was a lawyer defending the little man from corporations. Now they wish for us to allow their machines to thrive despite their attempts on the Kingfish's life. Let's see if they are so smug when the radical DWL gets a taste of their own medicine and the regressive Southern machine is wholly replaced by a progressive one."
TEX_black_support:0 "Black Support"
TEX_black_support_desc:0 "With our desire to displace the Old Democrats whole cloth we have gained a more positive reputation with the black population. While Huey has long been ambigious on Civil Rights issues he has suddenly found himself more vocally supporting increased spending on black communities as the expense of the landed elite of the South, leading to a rapid increase in black AFP supporters."
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie:0 "Shake Hands with Dixie"
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie_desc:0 "The Old Democrats are finished on a national scale but their machine in the South remains. The Union made a terrible and costly mistake in bothering to oppose it after the Civil War, one we should not repeat. While we will hunt down the irreconciable White Leagers we should cut a deal with the Southern Democrats whom now look to us for protection, promising not to uproot them so long as they do not oppose Long."
TEX_a_new_solid_south:0 "A New Solid South"
TEX_a_new_solid_south_desc:0 "The Southern Democrat machine lost the war and as a result learned its place under Long, whom they are already making appeals to support on the nation level if allowed to maintain their machines in the South and given some autonomy. So long as they weed out radical anti-Longists and pay their share their is no need to further disrupt the South as they are now a reliable voting block and White League opposition is winding down."
TEX_expand_the_minute_men:0 "Expand the Minutemen"
TEX_expand_the_minute_men_desc:0 "In order to preserve the integrity of our armed forces, we must expand the Minutemen into the field of civil protection and border monitoring.

TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Members of Congress have devised a way to establish a baseline of trust in our democratic system that is sorely needed.

TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyalty"
TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The Fish Act's critics rightfully stated that there was no incentive for officials to sign the affidavits. In response a second Act is passed to provide compensation for the time spent in the public service during the Civil War that was postponed by the Federalists. This back-pay would require signing the aforementioned affidavit, of course."

TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "Executive acts have been used to create agencies to serve the American people in the past, so long as it does not intrude into state sovereignty. In the past, this power has led to corruption from corporate interests. The president is, however, incorruptible. Turning the tables against the monopolies and grafters is his promise to America."

America is no place for cowardly traitors!"
TEX_reform_the_fbi:0 "Reform the FBI"
TEX_reform_the_fbi_desc:0 "It was inevitable that government agencies like the FBI would be shattered by the civil war. Despite their hostility to Pelley in the 1930’s the President sees the need and utility of such an organization.

TEX_christian_commonwealth:0 "The Christian Commonwealth"
TEX_christian_commonwealth_desc:0 "The time has come for Pelley’s most grand idea to be put into motion. The Christian Commonwealth is a vast overhaul of the entire American economy into a hybrid system where private businesses can still exist but they will all be subservient to and part of the Commonwealth Corporation.

Hugo Black responded to the press by profusely apologizing, and saying that his membership was just perfunctory in order to get elected in Alabama.

unionstate.17.d:0 "The public’s understanding of Share Our Wealth and Every Man A King is predicated largely on song and slogan. Although many Americans today sing along, there persist Democrats who continue to say our program is crypto-socialism, especially among Texan Democrats. Their contention is slowly damaging our reputation within the nation. Perhaps we should grant Texas more autonomy to calm their accusations."

unionstate.18.d:0 "Up in the sky! It's a bird? It's a plane? No, it's Superman! Saving America from the terror of the Klan of the Fiery Cross. This latest series is the brainchild of Siegel and Shuster partnered with an anti-Klan advocate Stetson Kennedy. This tale has successfully embarrassed the illegal organization further, something that is much needed considering the damage they've done to our nation."
unionstate.18.a:0 "Kids love it."

unionstate.19.t:0 "Governor Long Fires on Protesters"
unionstate.19.d:0 "Governor Earl Long has long dodged accusations of corruption and mismanagement of money. As the brother of President Huey Long, Earl has been immune from prosecution and is usually handled delicately by the press. Earl's administeration has been charged to distribute veteran benefits and basic income to the people of Louisiana, with the assumption that all loyal Americans would be deserving of this welfare. A group of concerned citizens, including hundreds of veterans and poor from Norther Louisiana have gathered in Baton Rouge, claiming that Earl Long has withheld their income and benefits. Governor Earl tried to speak to the crowd, claiming that the funds have yet to arrive from the capital, and to disperse until that day. The protesters, many of whom were black veterans, began chanting for Earl's resignation. While accounts differ about what happened next, anywhere from 20-50 people lie dead among the protesters. It now lies with President Huey to pick up the pieces. Governor Earl is appealing to his brother to help him with damage control. The press are not quite at a fever pitch, and any move Huey does could swing public opinion at the moment. "
unionstate.19.a:0 "Attend the funerals of the protesters."
unionstate.19.b:0 "Help Earl cover this up."

unionstate.20.t:0 "Black No More"
unionstate.20.d:0 "The imaginations and political opinions of Americans were piqued when Black No More, written by author George Schuyler, appeared on bookshelves. The book is a science fiction about a scientist who invents a machine that can turn a black man white. This invention turns society upside down, and challenges ideas on race and the one drop principle. The book continues with the revelation that all the characters, both white and black, are mixed race, and the entire principle of racial supremacy collapses. While there were concerns that the book would be censored due to its veiled attacks against both white supremacists and black leaders, it appears that President [TEX.GetLeader] enjoys the book."
unionstate.20.a:0 "As long as it doesn't offend me."

unionstate.21.t:0 "Election Demands!"
unionstate.21.d:0 "As it is clear the AUS is attempting to take up the former mantle of the original American Government, there have been increasing demands for an election to decide the future leader of America in a democratic manner. With a political structure that mimics the old electoral structure of America, the progressives and leftover democratic party have been most vocal in this endeavor. As we rely on their support just to keep afloat, there is not much we can do but agree for now."
unionstate.21.a:0 "Very well!"

unionstate.2100.t:0 "National Progressive Campaign"
unionstate.2100.d:0 "The National Progressive Party has expanded beyond the La Follete families immediate domain and is now dominant in many farm regions in the North and Mid-West. Campaigning on a platform of political reform and of endorsing progressive economics free of "corruption", a clear reference to the AFP. Having already absorbed most of the remaining Republican Party, they poss a significant threat to the left-wing of the AFP and, of course, have already eaten into our progressive and farmer support, leaving some to say we should pay more lip service to our left-wing."
unionstate.2100.a:0 "Promise them more!"
unionstate.2100.b:0 "No, we would alienate the right"

unionstate.22.t:0 "Formation of the Christian Party"
unionstate.22.d:0 "With the growth of the Silver Legion under William Dudley Pelley and the announcement of the election, the Christian Party has announced it will stand at the next elections. Eating into the support of the right-wing of the AFP and the now rump Democratic Party, the Christian Party is running on a protestant Christian Democratic platform with progressive economic policies including wealth dividends and full employment. Perhaps we should pander to our right-wing so as to stop their support?"
unionstate.22.a:0 "That would do more harm than good"
unionstate.22.b:0 "Yes, of course"

unionstate.23.t:0 "Long associate disappears!"
unionstate.23.d:0 "A shocking scandal in Louisiana took place earlier this week when Sam Irby, the uncle to Long's secretary and rumored mistress, disappeared from his hotel room in the Gardner Hotel after it is said members of the Louisiana Bureau of Criminal Identification entered the building! This is a blow to the opposition Democrats whom are rumoured to have been interviewing Irby about Long's supposed affair with Irby's niece.

Irby claims that he kidnapped himself to throw off 'less than friendly loaners', a story few actually believe. AFP opponents accuse Long of wanting to hide Irby until the election was over to avoid potential scandals that would result from the man selling stories about Huey to the press but with Irby and his dapper new clothes claiming otherwise there is nothing they can do."

unionstate.26.t:0 "The Texas Devils"
unionstate.26.d:0 "The Texas Rangers are under our jurisdiction and their leader Col. Lee Simmons are loyal to us. They are currently struggling to contain the many domestic terrorist threats in our nation however. He has requested that we green light a plan to bring back famed Ranger Frank Hamer to once again tackle the Klan in our territory and provide funding to do so. This would undoubtedly weaken the Klan but perhaps their efforts would be more useful elsewhere?"
unionstate.26.a:0 "Greenlight it"
unionstate.26.b:0 "Target generic robbers instead"
unionstate.26.c:0 "Have them help train the troops instead"

unionstate.27.t:0 "Bonnie and Clyde gang"
unionstate.27.d:0 "While crime in rampant throughout the territory as criminals look to make a easy buck from the unstable nature of America one criminal group in particular has gained infamy, namely the Barrow gang. This is largely due to the sensationalist takes on Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, a couple apparently leading the gang and whom are often called Bonnie and Clyde for short. The activities of the whole gang involve mainly robberies sometimes even of banks, but increasingly members of law enforcement are getting gunned down, partly due to the heavy firepower the gang is packing. Famously Clyde Barrow himself carries a Browning Automatic Rifle. Unfortunately the gang is gaining an undeserved folksy reputation and undermining the legitimacy of the state, how should we respond?"
unionstate.27.a:0 "Send the Texas Rangers"
unionstate.27.b:0 "Send the National Guard"
unionstate.27.c:0 "We don't have the resources for this"

unionstate.28.t:0 "Pendergast Machine"
unionstate.28.d:0 "Tom Pendergast is the political boss of Kansas City and Jackson County with a reputation for running his cities as his personal fiefdom. Nonetheless, he is not very welcoming towards the COnstitutional American Republic whom hope to displace him and his system with the Old Democrats and other more hardcore white supremacists and prohibitionists whom view Pendergast as a seller of vice which in all honesty he is. Certainly this does not make him the greater evil to us nor are we to him, leading to him asking for protection. His machine would undermine the AFP power and not be wholly popular but would provide the AUS as a whole with greater resources, men who could be recruited in his territory and assistance from Pendergast's organized crime allies who could make our lives easier and CAR's more difficult. On the other hand we could just run AFP candidates in his territory and scare off him and his ally mobster Charles Carrollo by threatening to charge them should they not leave. What should we do?"
unionstate.28.a:0 "Make the alliance"
unionstate.28.b:0 "Kansas City ain't big enough for the two of us"

unionstate.29.t:0 "The Southern Tenant Farmers Union"
unionstate.29.d:0 "The Southern Tenant Farmers Union is a left-wing bureau for tenant farmers legally operating within our territory and supporting the American Union State over the rightist Constitutional American Republic, whom are repressing the STFU in their territory. This makes them potentially useful allies as they can help disrupt activities within the CAR if provided funding and perhaps even giving its leader Harry Leland Mitchell a seat on our cabinet. However, some in the party are reluctant to do so due to it being widely known the STFU has heavy sympathies with some of the Combined Syndicates of America despite not being based out of their territory. Providing support will surely help us shore up support but nonetheless would increase socialist sympathies and anger social conservatives who dislike the STFU's progressive stance on race issues."
unionstate.29.a:0 "Provide some support"
unionstate.29.b:0 "Put them on Our Cabinet"
unionstate.29.c:0 "I don't think so"

unionstate.30.t:0 "Progressive Merger Proposed"
unionstate.30.d:0 "Huey's main ally in Congress and now in the AUS has long been the Midwest Progressive and Farmer-Labor organizations despite an occasionally tense relationship due to disagreements with Long's style of populism and alleged demagoguery. However a recent proposal would strengthen this alliance. It comes from Alfred Mitchell Bingham, a radical activist and lead editor of the periodical Common Sense, is supportive of progressivism, the AFP and the right-wing of the CSA and is responsible for running the American Farmer-Labor Federation. The AFLF is made up of middle-class activists organizing mainly for the working class and which has connections with the AFP, the Progressives and even Bellaymists in the CSA. Despite the Federations flexibility it's stance on economic issues revolves around economic planning when it comes to agrarian goods and recently Bingham and other members of the Federation have begun to see the AFP as the best possible route to a radical but patriotic future. They have proposed forming the American Commonwealth Co-operative Movement, under which they would openly join the AFP in a political alliance. While this would shore up our support among left-leaning activists and undermine the National Progressive Party has potential competition it could tie us to more left-wing economic policies than some of our party members are comfortable with."
unionstate.30.a:0 "Of Course Not"
unionstate.30.b:0 "Absolutely, a fantastic opportunity"

unionstate.3001.t:0 "Second Great Migration"
unionstate.3001.d:0 "Despite the attempts of the Constitutional American Republic to force black Americans to stay in their territory, an increasingly large number of Black Americans are fleeing to the North and West. The total is likely numbering in at least a million, with many seeking to settle in our territory due to its obvious proximity. In particular, the urban regions of Texas are seeing an inflow of Black migrants but the machines representing many whites, particularly the questionably loyal local Democratic Parties as well as part of the AFP, are demanding we take away their right to vote so as to not threaten their political supremacy. White populists such as Gerald L.K. Smith suggest also stopping anymore blacks from entering so as to not threaten the white working class. However, much of the AFP and Progressives disagree with this and alongside our generals see an opportunity for recruitment and potential factory workers. They recommend allowing the migrants to settle and recruiting them at once."
unionstate.3001.a:0 "Let them in"
unionstate.3001.b:0 "Let them in, but they can't vote"
unionstate.3001.c:0 "Announce we won't be taking in anymore"

unionstate.3002.t:0 "The Old Regulars"
unionstate.3002.d:0 "The Regular Democratic Organization is Louisian's political machine for conservative Democrats and are Long's traditional opponents in his home state. Despite this the two have made alliances in the past and with the "Old Regulars" having questionable loyalty to the AUS over CAR or the USA now might be the time to make another such alliance, agreeing not to run AFP candidates in Southern Louisiana in return for them not openly opposing us. Of course, some Old Regulars have already crossed over to the Old Democrats and refuse to support Long, begging the question of whether we should simply "investigate" the organization for corruption and have it basically shut down which would also increase the AFP's hold on the state. Of course, this would push the old money elite even more against Long as well as the most ardent white supremacists."
unionstate.3002.a:0 "Cede part of Louisiana"
unionstate.3002.b:0 "Investigate them"

unionstate.3003.t:0 "Black Troop Debate!"
unionstate.3003.d:0 "The question of black combat troops has long been a contentious one in the United States, with race traditionalists insisting that blacks lack the intellectual faculties to be combat troops whereas others insist this is an absurd position and simply robs us of much needed soldiers. Currently Gerald L.K. Smith leads the charge on behalf of race traditionalists, insisting that blacks can not be expected to be soldiers and gain the same benefits as white soldiers. Charles Coughlin and much the Silver Legion are in accordance with this, although Pelley himself is ambivalent about letting Northern Blacks join as combat troops he is a hardliner when it comes to Southern Blacks, insisting they lack the 'intelligence and civility' to be troops. On the other side, Jacob Devers, the AFP machine in Louisiana and the Radicals in the AUS such as the Non-Partisan League, have pushed for black combat troops, admonishing the traditionalists for wanting to choose defeat just to spite blacks. They insist we should have Devers lead a recruitment campaign."
unionstate.3003.a:0 "We need black troops"
unionstate.3003.b:0 "We can not allow it"

unionstate.3004.t:0 "Minneapolis Syndicalists Strike!"
unionstate.3004.d:0 "While the state of Minnesota is in the control of the farmer-labor party, there remains a strong IWW element within Minneapolis whom have grown increasingly unstable since former governor Floyd Olson, whom held amicable relations with them, died. Now they are clearly desiring to join the CSA, and putting down their strikes would not only antagonize the socialists but cost us some manpower. Either we will have to pay them off of send national guard to quell them. Of course some radicals in the AFP would prefer to just give them semi-autonomy in part Minneapolis, allowing them to run it along more syndicalist lines so long as they do not attack members of the middle and upper class living there, and instead we will pay off business owners. They claim this will quell their anger altogether."
unionstate.3004.a:0 "Pay them off"
unionstate.3004.b:0 "Break them"
unionstate.3004.c:0 "Give them some autonomy"

unionstate.3005.t:0 "Silver Legion Grows"
unionstate.3005.d:0 "For conservatives who are dissapointed in the Democratic Party for their lack of populist credentials compared to other factions but who are also turned off by the AFP's and NPP's progressivism, the Silver Legion's mix of conservatism and wealth redistribution has become an increasingly attractive alternative. The Democrats are becoming increasingly unpopular among the farmers and 'legacy' democrats who supported them before and are increasingly a party of tradesmen and some middle-class iberals based largely out of Texas."
unionstate.3005.a:0 "Interesting"

unionstate.3006.t:0 "Leander Perez Controversy!"
unionstate.3006.d:0 "Leander Perez is an openly corrupt judge, hardline segregationalist and political boss operating out of Louisiana whom has made an alliance of pragmatism with Huey Long. Recently he has found himself in a controversy as journalists working for our political opponents have discovered his mishandling of oil leases under his watch, handing out contracts for bribes or to companies he ownes. Perez is a powerful ally but his handling of the oil contracts is forcing us to take a stand on this. Of course, this could be an opportunity to get rid of Perez, especially since in the future he will likely cause problems if we stray from his vision."
unionstate.3006.a:0 "Defend him"
unionstate.3006.b:0 "Have him step down"

unionstate.3007.t:0 "Perez Demands Compensation!"
unionstate.3007.d:0 "Perez is infuriated by our attempts to make him stand down! He is demanding that we compensate him for his work if we desire to maintain our current alliance, and has threatened us if we take legal action, claiming he has more than enough evidence to take Long down with him. What should we do?"
unionstate.3007.a:0 "Pay him off"
unionstate.3007.b:0 "Get rid of him"

unionstate.3008.t:0 "Leander Perez Kidnapped!"
unionstate.3008.d:0 "Leander Perez has recently disappeared after a falling out with Huey Long. According to reports, the fight was over his position as district attorney within Louisiana and his diversion of funds Long wanted to fund the war effort. He was apparently ambushed exiting a courthouse and entering his car, after which whomever was already in the car and the driver kidnapped him. Why his bodyguards did not intervene is unknown but while Long has blamed the dissappearance on socialists most don't doubt that Perez is in a swamp somewhere. With an example made, we could allow the machine he set up to go back to its usual business or we could appoint one of our own, which may be useful if we do not plan to follow the right-wing agenda of the Perez machine, with Cat Doucet being floated as an AFP representative who can take the plce of Perez and reform his machine to be more in-line with our values."
unionstate.3008.a:0 "Let the Machine do what it will"
unionstate.3008.b:0 "Cat Doucet should be rewarded for his loyalty"

unionstate.34.t:0 "Fate of the wealthiest opponents"
unionstate.34.d:0 "The wealthiest American families whom aligned themselves with MacArthur such as Rockefeller and Morgan made a point to destroy Long so that they may end the notion of a wealth ceiling that would see them far less wealthy. Their gambled failed however, and while they have fled the nation we have taken control of their businesses left here in the states. For the large stockholders, we will have to decide if we should wholly take control of these businesses, and sell them to someone new, or allow them to retake control under new corporate leadership so long as they pay fines."

unionstate.35.t:0 "Smith Walks Out!"
unionstate.35.d:0 "Gerald L.K. Smith has finally had 'enough' of our shifting the party to the left and declared that he is formally joining the Christian Party, declaring us race traitors who are unwilling to stand against 'Jewish Power and syndicalist radicals'. He takes with him much of the right-wing of the AFP, leaving us more reliant on collecting former leftists to vote for us."
unionstate.35.a:0 "So be it"

unionstate.36.t:0 "Virgil Effinger killed!"
unionstate.36.d:0 "In a cabin in Tennessee, Virgil Effinger and 12 members of the Black Legion were killed today when they were tracked down by AFP Minutemen who opened fire on the cabin in the dead of night. The Black Legion has decied this as a war crime, claiming that Effinger was not only given no chance to surrender but that Black Legion watchmen were killed before they could issue a warning, meaning the Minutemen had no intention of giving them a chance to surrender. However the operation is being celebrated across America and Ranger Manuel T. Gonzaullas, whom lead the raid, is already being awared with medals as this will most assuredly kneecap the Black Legion."
unionstate.36.a:0 "Even more victories!"

unionstate.38.t:0 "Klan Clemency?"
unionstate.38.d:0 "With our decision to reconciliate the South old class we must decide how far to go in granting clemency to the Klan. Should we pardon lower-level members whom have take an oath of loyalty or simply force the American First Party in the South keep them in prison and try to keep Klan presence to a minimum, threatening them with retaliation if they go beyond talk."
unionstate.38.a:0 "Grant Clemency"
unionstate.38.b:0 "No, we can't let the Klan grow"

unionstate.39.t:0 "Southern Party Head"
unionstate.39.d:0 "The AFP has successfully expanded into the South using the old Democrat machines in the region for our own gain, but who should lead the organization in the deep south? There is Richard Russell Jr, who was a known moderate during the war and one of the more reluctant members of CAR, openly hoping they would shift closer to the center, however he is somewhat too socially conservative for many. Then there is James Eastland, who is more hardline on race issues but far more open to Long's economic agenda. Finally, we could pull some strings to place Earl Long in charge of the region."

unionstate.40.t:0 "Black Share our Wealth Chapters Close"
unionstate.40.d:0 "Feeling betrayed by our decision to reconciliate with the Southern Democrats and push them aside politically speaking, many black Share Our Wealth clubs have shut down, most prominent being the one ran by Reverend J.H.

unionstate.40.a:0 "Damn!"

unionstate.41.t:0 "Dallas Klan Attacks Share Our Wealth!"
unionstate.41.d:0 "The Dallas Klan is known for having had a a more ambiguous relationship with the National Klan and did not outright side with the CAR, saving itself from the state crackdowns that destroyed or damaged other Klans in the American Union State. However, with our embrace of the black vote they seem to think they have made a mistake, and have vandalized a local Share Our Wealth club, followed by sending threatening letters to black reverends now embracing Huey Long. What should we do?"
unionstate.41.a:0 "Focus on them now"
unionstate.41.b:0 "We will deal with them later"

unionstate.42.t:0 "AFP Southern Leader"
unionstate.42.d:0 "As the AFP machine consumes the Southern Democrats and Old Democrats machines we will need to entrust a leader to oversee that our sympathizers, including black voters, are put on the voting rolls there. We could place longtime loyalist Rush Limbaugh Sr, who lead the AFP in the region throughout the war in the region, in charge. Another choice is Civil War veteran and AFP rising star Sid McMath. Finally, we could pull some strings to put Earl in charge."
unionstate.42.a:0 "Rush Limbaugh Sr."

unionstate.42.c:0 "Earl Long"

unionstate.43.t:0 "Old Democrats resist!"

unionstate.43.a:0 "Damn!"

unionstate.44.t:0 "New Film: My First 100 Days!"
unionstate.44.d:0 "The newest political film out of Hollywood is proving to be a smashing success! My First One Hundred Days is a film about Huey Long's first 100 Days after winning the America Civil War and bringing peace and prosperity to the United States, as directed by Gregory La Cava. With an opening with the actual Huey Long endorsing the film and wishing all Americans well, critics claim that the film being funded by the AFP makes it little more than a piece of government propaganda. Nonetheless, it is popular with Americans looking for an optimistic view of the nation, a promise of unity and a leader who will protect them."
unionstate.44.a:0 "Very Good!"

unionstate.45.t:0 "Fate of Standard Oil"
unionstate.45.d:0 "With Standard Oil coming under our control, we have decided to keep the oil in Louisiana under government control. However the fate of the rest of our national reserves has come under debate, with some wanting us to break up Standard Oil into many companies and the US government simply owning a share of it while hardliners in the AFP would prefer if we just keep the oil nationalized and use the funds towards national projects."
unionstate.45.a:0 "Break it up"
unionstate.45.b:0 "Nationalize it"

unionstate.46.t:0 "Power of Congress"
unionstate.46.d:0 "Huey Long has made it clear that he will not leave the White House unless it's in a box, signing executive acts that expands his powers and declaring the AFP a government organization that is now virtually unchallengeable and has full control over voter rolls for the Presidential elections, with the army now lower ranking than the Minutemen politically speaking. Congress is another issue however, and some AFP members claim legitimate opposition should be allowed to exist there and in the Supreme Court. The Protect America Act put forward by hardliners and backed by the Louisiana machine and Townsend would effectively give the president full legislative and judicial power, and all him to remove troublesome congressmen from power, although this would drop all pretense of national democracy even if local elections and interaction with the government through town councils and party machines continue to exist."
unionstate.46.a:0 "Don't Pass the Act"
unionstate.46.b:0 "Pass the Act"

unionstate.47.t:0 "Protests throughout the Nation"
unionstate.47.d:0 "The Protect America Act has caused a wave of protests throughout the nation in opposition to Long's new status as America's presidential dictator. Civil liberties advocates in the ACLU have organized the largest protests in Louisiana and D.C. as both symbolize the wedding of the AFP machine with the American Government. The AFP inner circle believe light intimidation tactics such as scaring critical journalists will be enough, although Earl Long would prefer we just outright break up the protests through the national guard."
unionstate.47.a:0 "Intimidate the ACLU"
unionstate.47.b:0 "Shut down the protests"

unionstate.48.t:0 "The National Sensation of Share our Wealth Clubs"
unionstate.48.d:0 "Share our Wealth Clubs are quicky becoming as popular as church, with an increasing number of Americans using the clubs to not only to advocate for their political views but using them to coordinate group activists ranging from community service to poker days to bookstores. Because of this the National Share Our Wealth Society is requesting funds to increase their presence as it becomes an integral part of not just wealth redistribution but civic activities."
unionstate.48.a:0 "Of Course"

unionstate.49.t:0 "Archbishops seek support"
unionstate.49.d:0 "Perceving Long as a useful ally against both the Klan and socialists, many archbishops are coming around to Long's 'Distributionism' after previously being hostile to Charles Coughlin's influence among the Catholic population, with the most notable being Archbishop Edward Aloysius Mooney whom is now openly embracing Long's regime. Privately, the Archbishop desires increased funding for Catholic diocoses, for Long to endorse friendship with Catholic nations and for it to be easier to Catholic immigrants to become naturalized immigrants. However Coughlin supporters still in the AFP do not desire any such agreement, thinking Long should do it without their approval since they view the clericy with suspicion for not endorsing them sooner. However, the Archbishops promise increased support for Longism if he agrees."
unionstate.49.a:0 "Agree"
unionstate.49.b:0 "No, we are beholden to Catholic supporters not the Church"

unionstate.50.t:0 "Treasury Demands Capital Controls!"
unionstate.50.d:0 "As it becomes clear that Long is deadset on enacting his Share Our Wealth plans many are concerned that many amongst the wealthy, despite having just been saved from socialist revolution, will still attempt to flee the nation with their riches! ALready the treasury, IRS and interior ministry are reporting talk of moving out of the nation and are begging us to enact capital controls which would make it more difficult to leave the country. Two plans have been put forward, one that would set a limit on how much the wealthy can take abroad and another that would tax foreign investments and force those moving to a new country to pay a fee that absorb nearly all of their wealth behind, ensuring they most likely would not."

unionstate.5101.t:0 "Long Dead!"
unionstate.5101.d:0 "Huey Long died today, unable to survive his wounds. Today is a day of national mourning and widespread violence against groups associated with the assassins is common. His funeral is expected to be the largest in US history as the masses will march alongside his casket in true Louisiana fashion. With the Vice-Presidency essentially being controlled by the AFP many want to simply select a new leader until the next election to help the nation heal from this loss, and there has been no shortage of infighting but the parties current position leaves only a handful able to take the position, with Earl Long competing with more ideological faction leaders for AFP and congressional support."

### Pelley Events ###

unionstate.52.t:0 "Fate of Murphy Ranch"
unionstate.52.d:0 "Now that our Legion reaches from coast to coast, we must revisit our place of final resort Pelley had planned out. In the outskirts of L.A, this compound was built a ranch to sustain the Silver Legion in case of a syndicalist victory. Murphy Ranch, as it is called, now has the ability to become fully operational. Should we continue to fortify the homestead to protect our new Californian brothers? Or should we convert the land into a workplace for our reborn American industry?"
unionstate.52.a:0 "Fortify it."
unionstate.52.b:0 "Convert it."

unionstate.53.t:0 "Can You See The Real Pelley?"
unionstate.53.d:0 "Although only known to the highest-ranking members of The Silver Legion, there is a hidden depth in the mind of our Chief Pelley. To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend. He is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now, a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one and the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well-accepted in this brave new American society, should we go public with some of his more... esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers, as it is, can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public at large. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"
unionstate.53.a:0 "Too many would fear this."
unionstate.53.b:0 "The world is ready."

unionstate.54.t:0 "Pelley Speech Attracts Controversy!"
unionstate.54.d:0 "During a controversial speech presidential candidate William Dudley Pelley endorsed what he has called the 'Ward System' for various groups labeled 'unproductive' which would ensure they do not receive full Commonwealth benefits until they are labeled as productive and would be relegated to largely labor jobs in the mean time. Naturally this has attracted a large amount of criticism while also appealing to former Democrats and racially conservative Republicans despite Pelley's claim the Ward System is 'radically different' from the ODP's Segregation platforms. Perhaps speaking out against it can increase our percent of the black and liberal votes, although it does threaten to drive away some voters."
unionstate.54.a:0 "Denounce the Speech"
unionstate.54.b:0 "Do nothing"

unionstate.55.t:0 "The Silver Cavalcade!"
unionstate.55.d:0 "With President Pelley having won a surprise electoral victory it has become clear that he needs to further his grassroots support if his most ambitious plans are to have any hope of succeeding. After several meetings with his advisors the President believes he has come up with the ideal plan for this, a nationwide barnstorming tour with members of the Christian Party and the Silver Legion. Seen live, broadcast both on radio and recorded to be shown after the fact, the Silver Cavalcade as it is now being called internally will surely spread our message further than ever before."
unionstate.55.a:0 "Fund it"
unionstate.55.b:0 "Actually, let's wait on this"

unionstate.56.t:0 "Jewish Segregation?"
unionstate.56.d:0 "As our platform is implemented more and more, one of the President's more controversial ideas has again reared its head. In Pelley’s mind the influence of the American Jewish population on both the capitalist and syndicalist systems and the growing population of politically aware Gentiles necessitates that they need to be stripped of certain rights for the time being, ostensibly for their own protection. Under the plan the Jewish population in each state would be moved to a single city until the Commonwealth system is fully implemented, at which time the President promises they will again receive full rights. Regardless of his promises though the idea has attracted outrage from a not insignificant portion of the population who claim it will lead to mass abuses and other rights violations, and on the other hand the hardliners in the Christian Party are demanding an immediate implementation of the plan. It seems like no matter what choice we make could cause us further problems in the future."
unionstate.56.a:0 "Implement it"
unionstate.56.b:0 "It's too controversial"

unionstate.57.t:0 "Our Problem Children"
unionstate.57.d:0 "In recent years the Christian Party has blossomed to become one of the largest in these United States, however this has not been without its own set of problems. Several elements of the Christian Party, particularly those in California, have taken their rhetoric far and beyond what the national leadership has. Led by Henry D. Allen's wing of the party as well as the increasingly controversial Gerald L.K. Smith it espouses radical racialist doctrines and promoting ideas such as the mass expulsion of Jews from the United States, these groups are increasingly harming the Presidents image and one way or another we need to make a choice on how to best handle the situation, with Willard Kemp offering to help reign them in via private conversations and threats of expulsion."
unionstate.57.a:0 "Do nothing"
unionstate.57.b:0 "Reign them in"

unionstate.58.t:0 "Slow growth of Soulcraft"
unionstate.58.d:0 "One of the more peculiar parts of President Pelley’s beliefs are his esoteric approach to Christianity. Known under several different names in prior years, Soulcraft Doctrine as it is now known has seen a slow but steady growth under the Pelley administration. Whilst the President has suspended any new publications on the matter to avoid First Amendment cases, prior works such as the Golden Scripts are being sold in higher numbers and more and more people seem open to exploring the President's ideas on not just politics and economics, but spirituality as well. Of course, this has also caused ridicule from papers such as the L.A. Times who mock Pelley as a 'guru', making many in the party reluctant to push the matter further."
unionstate.58.a:0 "Publish more Soulcraft"
unionstate.58.b:0 "A fine development"

unionstate.59.t:0 "Calling in Favors"
unionstate.59.d:0 "It is no secret that the President is the most powerful man in these United States, but even a powerful man at times has need for favors and assistance. In the years before he assumed the Presidency Pelley acquired a long list of contacts in several fields, particularly in finance, industry and politics, through his authorship followed by his leadership of the Silver Legion. Whilst our programs are being speedily implemented and the Chiefs vision of America becomes truer by the day it might be wise to call in these favors and outstanding debts, even if it might appear unpopular to the masses."
unionstate.59.a:0 "Of course"
unionstate.59.b:0 "No, it's corrupt"

unionstate.5900.t:0 "The Ward System"
unionstate.5900.d:0 "Due to his campaign promises, the Pelley administration is faced with a controversial idea that needs resolved. In the past, now President Pelley spoke of a system that in his eyes would allow the government to best help and uplift its most impoverished citizens. Known as the Ward System, the idea would see those Americans identified as most impoverished (particularly Appalachian whites, deep southern blacks and Mexican immigrants) become Wards of the state and be brought under its care. However, Pelley identifies these elements as the most unproductive in society and would deny them full Commonwealth benefits, relegating them to largely labor jobs. While in theory the system would be used to educate these peoples and ensure they can enter the Commonwealths workforce on an equal footing some have expressed outrage and compared the idea to modern slavery. The President calls these claims outrageous and a step forward from the old Jim Crow system but a choice must be made on the matter immediately, with challenges by ACLU and NAACP lawyers as well as the opposition parties making the mainstream of the CP more reluctant to endorse it."
unionstate.5900.a:0 "Implement the Wards"
unionstate.5900.b:0 "No, we should step back"

unionstate.5901.t:0 "Cleansing Hollywood"
unionstate.5901.d:0 "Before entering the realms of either spirituality or politics, Pelley was a rather successful screenwriter for Hollywood and while he eventually grew disgusted with the industry and its supposed Syndicalist influence he has always maintained a fondness for the silver screen, and in turn it began to despise him. Recently the President organized a showing of several of the films he helped make in his heyday at the White House and afterwards he announced a number of executive orders seeking to cleanse Hollywood of any anti-American sentiments and sponsoring the opening of new studios so that Americans may once again enjoy cinema if Hollywood did not 'clean up its act' at once. Much of the right-wing of the CP is pushing for him to simply implement these policies now however and Pelley would prefer it that way, although many in the cabinet view it as too radical."
unionstate.5901.a:0 "Clean up Hollywood"
unionstate.5901.b:0 "We'll give them a chance"

unionstate.5902.t:0 "The First Americans"
unionstate.5902.d:0 "Is there any group more disadvantaged and stepped on in the modern United States than its original inhabitants? President Pelley certainly doesn’t think that’s the case, having for several years written about the plights of various Indian groups and peoples and the attempts by various groups to seize their lands or turn them to beliefs like Syndicalism in an effort to manipulate them. In a recent speech to Congress the President swore that these transgressions would end now and forever, promising to strengthen and strongly enforce the treaties the Federal Government has with the Indian Nations and ensure these groups have equal opportunities under the Commonwealth system."
unionstate.5902.a:0 "It was needed"


### Progressive Events ###
unionstate.60.t:0 "Effinger Captured!"
unionstate.60.d:0 "Black Legion leader Virgil Effinger has been captured by our forces after the military uncovered his hideout and forced him and his bodyguards to surrender. Now, Effinger and his top men are going to be tried by our government but the attorney general is asking us if we should pursue the death penalty or not? While some activists in our ranks would prefer to stick to our anti-death penalty stance most everyone else believes we should favor the death penalty. Since Effinger will absolutely be convicted this will decide his fate."
unionstate.60.a:0 "Pursue the Death Penalty"
unionstate.60.b:0 "A Life Sentence is better"

unionstate.61.t:0 "Cutting the Red Tape"
unionstate.61.d:0 "With the Plumb Plan being enacted [TEX.GetLeader] cut the red tape on the ATSF railway in Wisconsin to symbolize a new railroad that is run by both the owners, workers and public. While initially costly to implement this is a widely popular event and has seen many Americans looking forward to a new America, and many unions among affected railroads viewing liberal reforms as superior to syndicalist policy."
unionstate.61.a:0 "Great"

unionstate.62.t:0 "Endorse Deweyism?"
unionstate.62.d:0 "John Dewey was a member of the social patriots in the CSA but who was sympathetic to us and repeatedly pushed for peace with the American Union State, and many of his adherents were among our own ranks as well. As such, his followers believe we should take the opportunity of refitting the education system to apply his theories of hands off teaching and self-learning to our schools, which they believe will better prepare our children to become citizens. Traditional teachers of course oppose the model."
unionstate.62.a:0 "Stick to old methods"
unionstate.62.b:0 "Embrace Deweyism"

unionstate.63.t:0 "Long criticizes the NPP!"
unionstate.63.d:0 "Huey Long has come out against 'sewer socialism', arguing that it does not go far enough to redistribute wealth while also leaving too much power in bureaucrats who do not represent the 'will of the people'. We have replied with accusations of Long's corruption but he has struck a chord among those who believe Long would have gone further to combat economic inequality although our economists believe it would have been for show."
unionstate.63.a:0 "Bastard!"

unionstate.64.t:0 "Black Support?"
unionstate.64.d:0 "The NAACP is petitioning us to make an effort to support black workers by removing racical barriers in being hired for our government programs and organizing them within our farmer-labor groupings. This has naturally caused ambivalance in the party despite many progressives favoring such measures, some are still nervous this could lead to a backlash and note that our black support during the election was not particularly high anyways."
unionstate.64.a:0 "Work with the NAACP"
unionstate.64.b:0 "We're not ready for that"

unionstate.65.t:0 "NPP absorbs the Farmer-Labor Party"
unionstate.65.d:0 "Concluding our negotiations with the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party and its leaders such as Elmer Austin Benson we have managed to finally make the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party a wing of the National Progressive Party! Shall we keep them a semi-autonomous force or push for them to be fully absorbed into the NPP?"
unionstate.65.a:0 "Absorb them"
unionstate.65.b:0 "Leave them some autonomy"

unionstate.66.t:0 "Large Contractors Offer Help"
unionstate.66.d:0 "While we promised to favor smaller contractors for our projects, the Kiewit Corporation has just made a very lucrative offer to help rebuilding Nebraska alongside our government. This would be much more efficient and quick than assembling many small contractors, and would see the state back on its feet in no time. However, Nebraska contractors would of course see this as a betrayal, even if we tried to have Kiewit work with them."
unionstate.66.a:0 "Work with Kiewit"
unionstate.66.b:0 "We'll stick by our guns"

unionstate.77.t:0 "Share Our Wealth Appoints Smith"
unionstate.77.d:0 "An impromptu meeting has been held among the board members of the Share Our Wealth program. The organisation's shareholders consist of members of the AFP, the Prohibiton Party, and the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. These board members met at 2am, straddling the line between official business and secrecy. William Upshaw, of the Prohibtion Party, brought to the fore President Long's apparent betrayal of his party values. The AFP board members agreed that Long's rejection of a main campaign promise bodes ill for more 'morally-centred' legislation in the future. Francis Townsend, who joined Huey Long in order to push his Old-Age Revolving Pension Plan, agreed it was necessary to elect a new representative for the Share Our Wealth program, someone who wouldn't be beholden to the president's whims. After much debate, it was decided that newly-elected Louisiana Congressman, Gerald L.K. Smith, is far enough removed from Long yet still dedicated to social security. As the votes were tallied in Smith's favour, the board pondered what Smith's association with the Silver Legion might mean in the future..."
unionstate.77.a:0 "How dare they!"

unionstate.78.t:0 "Dixiecrats Declare AFP Corrupt"
unionstate.78.d:0 "After the end of hostilities in Washington, a large section of the conservative Democratic Party pledged their alligence to [Root.GetNameDef] and to the ideals President Long follows. Implicitly, these Democrats hoped Long would fulfil their desires for more state power in exchange for allowing Long's economic reforms to easily pass. This unwritten promise was broken when Long denied them the ability to enforce Prohibition, going so far as to ignore their impassioned speeches in favour of repealing the Interstate Commerce Act. Many conservative Democrats now see the AFP's regime as merely a sham democracy that rejects any measure the Long political machine will not personally benefit from. The President was still shocked, however, when the halls of Congress were only 3/4 full this week. Currently legislation is frozen, and it appears the so-called Dixiecrats are taking all their vacation days at once."
unionstate.78.a:0 "Fools, we are their only home."

unionstate.79.t:0 "The Officers' Revolt"
unionstate.79.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to incentivise officers to remain in their positions during this very sensivite time, approximately one hundred army officers have expressed deep reservations for Huey Long's trial. The press has reported these dissenting opinions, and thus have also given us warning of the officers' coming protest in the capital in five day's time. We have no illusions these marchers will be peaceful, or that their march won't culminate in a demand for the Silver Legion to return power to the AFP. General Patton, still leading the Fifth Army, has promised he will protect our right to rule the Commonwealth. Giving him free reign against the marchers, however, will be a bloody battle that could easily backfire on us. Richard Butler has suggested instead having Legion supporters infiltrate the marcher ranks and disrupt them from within. Better to make the officers look unreasonable and foolish than to make the government appear tyrannical."
unionstate.79.a:0 "Give Patton free rein."
unionstate.79.b:0 "Accept Butler's plan."

unionstate.80.t:0 "Rebuilding the Constitution"
unionstate.80.d:0 "The Dixiecrats, who we tipped off about the 'arrest' of Long, have been useful in maintaining the facade that is Congress. The tedious proccess of replacing state representatives with Legionaries has meant that we have become more and more reliant on the Dixiecrats remaining content in the meantime. After a recent push by Chief Pelley to pass Amendments 22-24, bringing in a new "Grandfather" clause -depriving people of rights not enjoyed by their grandfather- and requiring a profession of faith in order to serve in Congress, the agenda has turned to Pelley's final amendment: reserving private and government land for redistribution to Christians. This has spawned a surprise backlash. The Dixiecrats claim this eminent domain impedes the rights of states to their own land, something Huey Long promised he wouldn't do. Chief Pelley is now in a bind. If he gives into the Dixiecrats, it will make him look weak at the very time he needs to look like he has all the answers. If he strongarms the amendment, as many of his advisers suggest, it dispels the illusion of democracy we so dearly need to maintain."
unionstate.80.a:0 "The states can have their rights - for now."
unionstate.80.b:0 "Have you read Matthew 20:26-27?"

### Military Research ###
unionstate.101.t:0 "The Future of Warfare"
unionstate.101.d:0 "After a long reshuffling of former US departments, the American Union State has uncovered old classified weapons proposals. The two proposals that caught the most interest are ones authored by Robert Goddard and Vannevar Bush, each proposing an expensive weapon project to deter invasions. Fortunately, both men were recovered from their respective hiding places, and persuaded into updating their proposals. Goddard's plan is for a liquid fuel rocket to deliver stable explosive payloads across long distances. Vannevar Bush's is a theoretical utilisation of nuclear fission to create a bomb based on experiments done in Europe. Which plan should we pursue?"
unionstate.101.a:0 "Goddard's Rocket."
unionstate.101.b:0 "Vannevar Bush's Bomb."

unionstate.102.t:0 "Missiles over White Sands"
unionstate.102.d:0 "After months of testing in the Southwest, and publishing several classified papers, the first test launch is prepared. In a fenced off area outside White Sands, New Mexico, Goddard's rocket stands ready. The rocket's design incorporates liquid fuel and stabilizers devised by Goddard with flight mechanics devised by Lindbergh Aircraft. At the head is a lower tonnage explosive meant to detonate after a set amount of time spent flying. A successful arc and explosion turns the New Mexico skyline on fire."
unionstate.102.a:0 "Nowhere is Safe."

unionstate.103.t:0 "Nuclear Power in New Mexico"
unionstate.103.d:0 "Hurdle after hurdle stood in between the American Union State and atomic weaponry. It began with a dearth of willing physicists and nuclear experts including Robert Oppenheimer who has yet to be located. Several other potential candidates signed a Humanist Declaration of pacifism abroad declaring their opposition to our program. Therefore, Bush has had to resort to industrial technicians which extended the timeline. Finally, after much testing and assistance from George Kistiakowsky, the first atomic bomb is tested. Due to the extensive safety precautions take, the vital test yielded an impressive blast but poor documentation."
unionstate.103.a:0 "We wear the Crown Atomic."

unionstate.104.t:0 "America is United"
unionstate.104.d:0 "At long last America has been united under [Root.GetNameDef]'s banner. Traitors and would-be tyrants have tried to destroy and corrupt this great nation, yet we held firm and took control. A question has arisen, however, in those territories which did not initially rise up with Huey Long in the civil war: is this country the United States of America, or is it truly [Root.GetNameDef]? There is a longing among many to return to the stability of the Stars and Stripes, even if things have irrevocably changed. Should we appease them and show that the America Huey originally envisioned still exists?"
unionstate.104.a:0 "Yes! We are the United States, now and forever."

unionstate.151.t:0 "The Second Declaration of Independence"
unionstate.151.d:0 "While many of the southern governors were in favour of drafting a new constitution on the spot, the urge to emulate the original rebellion against the British monarchy prevailed. A second Declaration of Independence was drafted in Baton Rouge over the course of a few days, painstakingly emulating the original conceit of the American Revolution. This declaration outlined the lack of protection the federal government gave to citizens, and the role of the state to protect the welfare of the poor. The signatories declare that it is within their constitutional right to organize a militia against tyranny, and that the federal government's deadline should not only be ignored it must be defied."
unionstate.151.a:0 "Annuit coeptis."

unionstate.152.t:0 "The American Union State Congress Convenes"
unionstate.152.d:0 "Through the grapevine, dozens of congressmen have heard of Huey Long's assembly in Baton Rouge. Some came to wish Long well and stayed, others simply to court favour with the revolution. These meetings in Baton Rouge began to take on a Congressional appearance, with Coughlin standing as the President of the attending senators. Aware of the growing determination to defy the federal government, and that this lack of willingness to negotiate meant civil war was all but certain, a large number of politicians have slinked away to the north... though those that remain seem more determined than ever to see victory."
unionstate.152.a:0 "They'll get theirs!"

unionstate.153.t:0 "Deadline Looms"
unionstate.153.d:0 "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Across the part of the country controlled by Long's supporters, an army formed of militia and the Minutemen has been raised and a growing determination to see the country remade by force has taken hold. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they no longer see a path to compromise."

###############################################

TEX_CLAIRE_LEE_CHENNAULT_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 6, 1890, in Commerce, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Claire Lee 'Old Leatherface' Chennault began his military career when he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps while he attended the Louisiana State University. He graduated from the Officers' School at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana in 1917, and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the Army Signal Corps soon after. He earned his wings in 1919 and remained in service after the air branch was turned into the Air Corps. In 1931, he became Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School, and would take charge of the 1st Pursuit Group of Alabama's Aerobatic Team, becoming a regional celebrity of his aerial feats. As 1937 loomed over, Chennault was considering resignation as the staff in Washington refused to promote him beyond Captain, considering him unfit for duty due to his declining health. When the American Civil War began, Chennault sided with the former Governor of Louisiana, giving Huey a small hike in recruitment as passionate observers of Chennault's performances filled the recruiting booths, and in exchange, Huey granted Chennault the honorary rank of Brigadier General for his service to the American Union State\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His health has been slowly deteriorating, with deafness and chronic bronchitis being the main issues Chennault will have to face sooner or later."
TEX_DADDY_COLLINS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joseph Lawton 'Lightning Joe' Collins began his military career in 1913 when he joined West Point thanks to an alternate appointment his uncle Martin Behrman, the major of New Orleans at the time, managed to get him at the age of 17 and graduated as an infantry second lieutenant in 1917. He'd stay as a teacher in West Point and marry Gladys Easterbrook in his time at the academy. In 1921, he began teaching Chemistry in West Point as well and in 1926, he graduated from the company officer course at the Infantry School in Fort Benning. A year later, he'd undergo and successfully complete an advanced course at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. After that, Collins taught weapons and tactics at the Infantry School from 1927 to 1932 where he requested a transfer to the Philippine Division from 1933 to 1934 and became a major. In 1935 and 1936, he graduated from Army Industrial College and the Army War College reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. \n§YImportant Notes:§W- An extremely talented yet aggressive commanding officer, his skills shine the most when leading an attack on the enemy rather than playing on the defence."
TEX_COURTNEY_HODGES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 05 January, 1887, in Houston County, Georgia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Courtney Hicks Hodges began his military career when he joined West Point in 1904, but was forced to drop out a year later due to his extremely poor academic performance. Undeterred, he enlisted in the army in 1906 as a private, where he quickly rose to the rank of sergeant in 1907 and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in 1909. He joined Pershing during the Punitive Expedition, where he met George S. Patton and George Marshall, and would remain in the Mexican border for the rest of the late 1910s, facing off several small skirmisher groups with the 6th Infantry Regiment. After being promoted to Major for his service at the border, he attended the Command and General Staff College, graduating in 1925 and becoming a member of the Infantry Board at Fort Benning. In 1934, graduated from the Army War College, earning him his promotion to lieutenant colonel."
TEX_WILLIAM_SIMPSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 18, 1888, at Weatherford, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W In June 1905, a month after turning 17, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated four years later in June 1909, being commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Infantry Branch.

Soon afterwards the regiment was sent overseas to Mindanao, in the Philippines, in January 1910 and remained there for another two-and-a-half years, where Simpson participated in the suppression of the Moro Rebellion. He returned to the United States with his regiment in 1912 and, being stationed at Fort Bliss, remained there as a company commander until, now promoted to first lieutenant, he fought in Pershing's Punitive Expedition in 1916. In February 1917 he became aide-de-camp to Major General George Bell, Jr., who commanded the El Paso Military District. Since 1919, Simpson has filled several staff appointments and attended military schools and courses and would be promoted in early 1921 to Captain. Simpson served with the General Staff until 1932 where he began teaching military science and tactics at Pomona College until 1936, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1934. As the country spiralled out of control, Simpson became more and more aligned with Huey Long's vision of America as time passed, and when Huey finally proclaimed the American Union State, Simpson presented his services to what he sees as the true American government. For his loyalty, Simpson was turned into a brigadier general."
TEX_JACOB_DENVERS_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 8 September 1887, in York, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Devers began his military career when Congressman Daniel F. Lafean offered him an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1906 and graduated on 11 June 1909 as an artillery second lieutenant.

On 1 April 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and he was transferred to the newly activated 9th Field Artillery at the Schofield Barracks in Hawaii and promoted to Captain in early 1917. In May 1919, Devers was sent on a three-month temporary duty assignment to study the Weltkrieg in Europe. He attended the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin to study the equipment and tactics used by both sides during the Weltkrieg. He was promoted to major on 1920 and he was later selected to attend the Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1925. He was then posted to Fort Sill as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929 where Devers was transferred to Washington, D.C., to serve on the staff of the Chief of Field Artillery. In 1932, he was chosen to attend the Army War College and graduated on June 1933. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 26 February 1934. With the country spiraling into Civil War, Devers found himself fighting more and more against his superiors inability to react to internal issues, starting a deep rivalry between him and Dwight Eisenhower, even putting him at odds with his old friend Leslie McNair. When Huey Long declared the Union State, Devers decided that MacArthur and his staff was a liability for America, and promptly volunteered for the AUS officer corp, where he was promoted to Field Marshall along with Terry De La Mesa Sr."

He'd graduate from the Army Command and General Staff School in 1935 and was attending the Army War College in Pennsylvania before the Civil War broke out. With the ever increasing radicalisation, he found himself being harassed several times by 'workers' militias' and slowly began losing faith in the Federal Government. When Huey Long finally proclaimed the American Union State, Ridgway decided it was best to leave for the AUS if that was necessary to save America from anarchy, where he was promoted to Brigadier General."

TEX_CLIFTON_CATES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 31, 1893, in Tiptonville, Tennessee, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Clifton Bledsoe 'Lucky' Cates began his military career after graduating from the Missouri Military Academy in 1910 as a second lieutenant for the Marine Corps Reserves.

Cates would serve with Barnett until 1923, where Cates, who was now a Captain, was assigned to command the Marine detachment in the USS Arizona. In 1928, he was transferred to the to the 4th Marine Regiment in San Diego which would be transferred to guard the American Legation in Shanghai.

He'd be then transferred to command the 'China Marines' in Shanghai in 1933 and would return to America in June 1936 to serve as an as an instructor at The Basic School. With the nation spiralling into Civil War, Puller was persuaded by Cates to join the American Civil War as Puller was indecisive as to who to support. With his arrival at Louisiana, Puller's actions in Nicaragua and Haiti had earned the respect of many members of the staff and Huey Long's cabinet, who pushed for his promotion to Brigadier General."
