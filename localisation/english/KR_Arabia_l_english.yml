### Leaders ###
POLITICS_AZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "Perhaps it was cruel fate that Saud bin Abdulaziz incurred the wrath of an Emir named Abdulaziz ibn Saud. Saud bin Abdulaziz was no stranger to strange and terrible events. The young Emir's crowning at age ten a machination of the Al Sabhan family, his maternal family. He witnessed as a young man the death of famous British Explorer William Shakespeare without ever realizing the humor in his name, or that his death would leave the Rashids with no allies during the Weltkrieg. Despite squabbling, the loss of the Rashid army to British maxim guns and a betrayal by his cousin, the Rashid family survived. A head on his shoulders allowed him to secure a protection deal with the Emir of Kuwait, the leader of the Howietat, and an unsteady peace with Nejd. Now this Emir is grown and ready to lead Arabia through the violence and betrayal towards a brighter future."
POLITICS_ABDULAZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "Born to a naïve Saud bin Abdulaziz aged only 20, Abdulaziz bin Saud did not know the harsh tent his father grew up in. When Abdulaziz's time came for military service, he chose instead to travel. On his personal pilgrimage on a horse with no name, he observed the changing world of warfare in Egypt and Constantinople. He returned to Ha'il not in a tawb, but in a fashionable black uniform ordered from Germany. Now that Saud bin Abdulaziz is dead, his son has determined to avenge his family and end the Saud feud once and for all."
POLITICS_GHAZI_DESC:0 "The only son of the late Faisal bin Hussein, Ghazi escaped the wrath of the Turks in Hejaz by hiding in El Esah with his cousin Zeid bin Hussein. In El Esah, Ghazi was cared for by the remaining forces of Lawrence's rebellion, but financial assistance from Britain dried up in 1926. This left Ghazi to seek protection from Ottoman soldiers with the Howietat. This led to a temporary truce between the Rashids and the Hashmites when the Howietat were admitted into Jabal Shammar. The influence of Ghazi's name is still strong, as well as the legacy of the Arab Revolt among Bedouins yearning for freedom. Thus, it was Ghazi's triumphant return to Mecca after the fall of the Ottomans that restored the greatness of his name."
POLITICS_SAEED_DUBAI_DESC:0 "Where war and rivalry only led to the stagnation of Arabia, trade and deleation will restore. This came from a speech given by the Emir Saeed al Maktoum upon receiving his office. His term as Emir of Dubai was one of exemplary diplomacy and a care for his peoples' wellbeing. Submission to the Sauds over a bloodbath in the 1920s, creation of economic ties to India when pearling failed the emirate, and finally a promise of peace. His dynasty being unilaterally more wealthy than the Rashids or Hashmitie may of helped as well."
POLITICS_SHAKBUT_JOR_DESC:0 "The House Al Nahyan was stuck in the crossroads of the Saud Rashid war. Their cities taxed cruelly by the Sauds, and thier commerce stunted. This destruction resolved Shakhbut Al Nahyan to formulate an economic plan for recovery involving western economists. This plan was presented to the Emirs, and early successes paved the way to Shakhbut's election. Al Nahyan weaves in his speeches the tales of how his ancestors of the Bani Yas migrated to the coast and found a land suitable to grow. Shakhbut's personal reputation among the Emirs is outstanding, and is only corrupted by the schemes of his own family. Shakhbut is confident that his reputation can save him from the machinations of family politics."
POLITICS_ABTAN_JOR_DESC:0 "Atban was the one-time rival and now successor to the famous soldier and Sheikh Auda abu Tayi. When Auda's ambitons failed, he retreated from Aqab into the Al Nefud. The Howietat's livestock starved, wells were denied to them. In desperation Atban ibn Jazi choose to again put aside his rivalry for the sake of thier people and seek aid from the Rashids. This bid was successful, and Atban became the representative of the Howietat. Auda's and his reputations for joining the Arab Revolt and facing the harshest of the Turkish reprisals made Atban a surprisingly good candidate for Emir. Atban challenged the Emirs to live among their own, and was rewarded with cooperation."
POLITICS_SABAH_JOR_DESC:0 "The Emirs of Kuwait began the century by setting the Rashid Saud conflict in motion, and it has finally paid off for them with the ascension of Jabe Al Sabah. It was Jaber's father who gave the Sauds arms and men in 1906 to retake Riyadh, a decision that would come back to haunt his son. The Ikhwan, Ibn Sauds frenzied soldiers attacked Kuwait when the British left, leaving devestation along the 1st Ring Road. Al Sabah prostrated himself to the Rashids, who forgave him and announced their protection of Kuwait. Now the Sabah are owed favors from the Rashids accrued during wartime, who exchanged this debt for a promise to elect Jaber al Sabah. Jaber himself reminding the emirs that he was first into battle on his horse against the Sauds, and that he alone could lead the charge against the Ottomans."
POLITICS_SAUDI_DESC:0 "Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the mortal rival of many dead men, now turns his sights towards Saud bin Abdulaziz. This rivalry began when the young Ibn Saud was ejected from his tent in Riyadh by the Rashids. Never a pawn of Emirs, ibn Saud's father rallied the destitute men of the coastal Emirates to the great goal of his dynasty, Wahhabism. The Rashids were then ejected at the cost of many men, including their only western ally. Ibn Saud himself started many a feud the Saudis inherited, as he expressed hatred towards any Arab who turned their nose up towards Bedouins. This seed of anger had passed onto his men, who inherited his ferocity and may turn this youthful fury against him yet."
POLITICS_SULTAN_OTAIBI_DESC:0 "An illiterate member of the Otaibah Bedouin tribe, Sultan came to head the so-called Ikhwan which formed a considerable portion of the forces of the house of Saud. Believing in a divine duty to spread Sunni fundamentalism, Sultan was none to pleased when the house of Saud attempted to limit his ability to raid neighbouring countries. Sultan now takes up arms against both his old allies in the house of Saud and the wider heathen world."

ARA_Power_Struggle_desc_JBS:0 "Time has not been very kind to the House of Rashid. Losing most of their male family members at the hands of the Ibn Saud and suffering from continuous raids into their territory by the Ikhwan, the Rashidi federation of Emirs is cracking under the weight of the Wahhabists. Support by the Ottoman Empire is keeping our dominion on its feet however as their continued partnership and alliance with our Emir ensures his lands are safe. Further reinforced in 1925 when the former British protectorates of the Trucial States, Qatar and Bahrain were returned to Ottoman custody, ties with the Sultan are strong.\n\nNonetheless some have argued that this partnership is the only thing keeping our realm together and should disaster befall the Ottomans, Ibn Saud may see it as his destiny to unite the peninsula under his rule."
ARA_Power_Struggle_desc_SAU:0 "For years we have waited for the opportunity to unite the Arabian peninsula under the House of Saud. Sadly the Ottoman watchdogs did not sleep with both eyes closed and when the British Empire fell in 1925, they more than rewarded their Rashidi lapdogs for their "loyalty" during the Weltkrieg. As we were left with nothing, devoid of allies and territorial gains, Abdulaziz grew ever more restless and vengeful.\n\nSaud bin Abd Al-Aziz may be enjoying the support of his Ottoman allies but dark clouds are gathering on the horizon and should his powerful benefactor find himself occupied in internal matters, his pathetic armies will have the face the Ikhwans rage all on their own..."

Zealous religious warriors, they are not bound by loyalty to Ibn Saud but by allegiance to the strict morals of Islamic society. Renouncing all Western advances, the Ikwhan wish to purify the Islamic world of its decadence and unite all muslims in a single unitary state.\n\nNonetheless they are an unruly and barbaric force, slitting the throats of all male prisoners they encounter and fighting with swords and lances. This makes them a worthy asset however to Ibn Saud as their zealously and bloodthirstiness is used in their infamous raids on the territories of our neighbours."

jbs.54.d:0 "The tent city of Ha'il saw the procession of sabers upon many soldiers' heads under Abdulaziz bin Saud Al Rashid's orders. In its wake is the procession of captured Emirs. The first group, including the Sauds, Duwaish, and Otaibi were deemed too rebellious to be loyal vassals to Jabal Shammar. The latter group, including the Al Nahyan, Hashimites and the Gadban of the Bani Lam, were more useful. Ibn Saud has decided to spare the families of the Emirs on the condition that they swear total alleigence to Jabal Shammar. This new form of alliance is different from the ruthless precedence Al Rashid's forefathers operated on, and are protected from the Ottomans in perpetuity. "

### Saudi Events ###
saud.1.t:0 "The Emirate of Nejd"
saud.1.d:0 "The Weltkrieg was one of many signs that we, the House of Saud, are destined the rule this land. In the hour of his greatest hubris, the Hashemites were abandoned by their infidel puppet masters and left for dead to the Turks and their puppet masters. While our inactivity in the war proved most fortuitous when it came time to avoid Ottoman retaliation, the decadent Turks hold no real sway over us. Now we bide our time, gathering warriors, money, and expertise to strike at the Rashidis, who think they can play both sides by accepting Hashemite warriors and pay lip service to the Porte, and finally unite Arabia under our flag!"
saud.1.a:0 "Long live the House of Saud."

saud.2.t:0 "Saudi Arabia"
saud.2.d:0 "Today with our victory over the house of Rashidis, the Saudis stand dominant. With this victory we shall rule over all Arabs!"

saud.56.d:0 "Reports have reached us that the Emirs of the Trucial States have succumbed to the advances of Ibn Saud. This sign of weakness is spreading to the other Emirs in the Rashidi alliance and cracks are already forming. Day by day, the power of our Emir is growing."
saud.56.a:0 "Another great victory!"

saud.57.t:0 "Qatar falls to Ibn Saud"

saud.59.a:0 "Another great victory!"

saud.150.t:0 "The Ikhwan rebel!"
saud.150.d:0 "The Ikhwan has been a strong army presence in Arabia for decades. They were also one of the principle reasons we were able to succeed in defeating the other Arab states and assert Saudi dominance in the region. However, the Ikhwan have always been a traditional group, highly religious, and vehemently against change and reform. They do not seem to understand that modernisation is necessary when ruling a nation. Normally, we can control any anger felt by the Ikhwan with promises that we won't modernise any more. However, it seems we've pushed them too far this time. Ikhwan soldiers have united under the leadership of Faisal Al Duwaish, an Ikhwan commander, who has declared that the Saudis are unfit to rule Arabia. Many Ikhwan militia have risen up, and fighting has already begun..."
saud.150.a:0 "We will crush these rebels, for Arabia!"

saud.151.t:0 "Emirs swear loyalty to the Saudi state"
saud.151.d:0 "The tent city of Riyadh saw the procession of sabres upon many soldeirs heads under Ibn Saud's orders. In it's wake is the procession of captured Emirs. The first, including the Rashidis, Hashimite, Al Thani and Howleitat were deemed too rebellious to be loyal vassals to Nejd. The latter, including the Al Nahyan and the Gadban of the Bani Lam, were more useful. Ibn Saud has decided to spare the families of the Emirs on the condition that they swear total alligence to the Saudi Arabia. This new form of vassalage is different from the ruthless precedence Ibn Saud's forefathers operated on, and are protected from the Ikhwan in perpetuity. "
saud.151.a:0 "Sufficient is Allah as our ally"

saud.152.t:0 "An Offer from [From.GetNameDef]"
saud.152.d:0 "We are involved in a war with [FROM.GetNameDef] due to our alliance with [OMA.GetNameDef]. However, with the capitulation of [OMA.GetNameDef], we have lost our only foothold in the Arabian peninsula. We are now faced with a choice - invade the peninsula by force, or seek peace and cut our losses."
saud.152.a:0 "Oman was not of much use, anyway."
saud.152.b:0 "We shall not betray our allies!"

saud.153.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Seeks Peace"
saud.153.d:0 "With the collapse of the [OMA.GetAdjective] defenses, their allies in [FROM.GetNameDef] were left without a foothold in Arabia - and as such, without any means to threaten us. Unfortunately, we are also unable to threaten or invade them in any way. [FROM.GetNameDef] has approached us with an offer - in exchange for peace, they will cut any ties with the [OMA.GetAdjective] state."
saud.153.a:0 "We are one step closer to uniting Arabia!"
saud.153.b:0 "No peace with the invaders!"

saud.154.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Declares Continuation of War"
saud.154.d:0 "While the collapse of the [OMA.GetAdjective] defenses brought hope that their allies in [FROM.GetNameDef] would attempt to cut their losses and seek peace, it appears that Muscat has found itself an ally willing to bleed itself dry."
saud.154.a:0 "The war goes on, then."

saud.155.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses our Offer!"
saud.155.d:0 "Despite our generous offer, the Arabs have refused any peace terms with the \"foreign invaders\"."
saud.155.a:0 "What?"
