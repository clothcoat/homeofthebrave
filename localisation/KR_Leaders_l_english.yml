## American Union State ##
POLITICS_GEORGE_VAN_HORN_MOSELEY:0 "Fourty years of service for the United States Army from a cavalry lieutenant in the Philippines to a Commissioned Officer in Washington has created a strong portfolio for Moseley. Experiences serving alongside generals like George Patton and General MacArthur influenced his eventual decision to support Huey Long and his adamant belief in Jewish conspiracy. Ultimately his belief in the dangers of any form of socialism made him the perfect spokesman of the War Powers Committee. Without Moseley would be impossible for the War Powers Committee to succeed Huey Long in the disappearance that Moseley was complicit in, so say the rumors."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_DUDLEY_PELLEY:0 "At age thirty-nine William Pelley was a rather unimaginative Hollywood screenwriter and journalist. His past adventures mostly consisting of visiting Russia and absorbing anti-Semitic pamphlets. By the time of his founding the Silver Legion in 1933, Pelley had cultivated his unique ideology, combining spiritualism, democracy, and faith. With Pelley's more eccentric views being reserved for trusted allies only. After his organisation was allowed to participate in elections by Huey Long, he went on to win the elections with his “Christian Party”. Anti-socialism and a belief in Christian Identity and Expanded Democracy are the ideals that forms the backbone of his government."
POLITICS_PAPPY_O_DANIEL_DESC:0 "Wilbert Lee O'Daniel has had a fascinating journey. Beginning his adult life as a flour salesman, he also branched out into music and radio, eventually taking over his company's radio advertising effort and making it into his own project. It was in this radio show that the "pass the biscuits, Pappy" phrase was first used, and it was also where O'Daniel would become a household name. During the recent turmoil in Texas and the rest of the country, O'Daniel decided to throw his lot in with Huey Long and the America First Party, believing them to be better representatives of the common people than the federal government, despite many disagreements on policy grounds. Now, having begun his own political adventure as the leader of the Democrats in Texas and the Union State as a whole, he hopes to lead America through the current crisis with nothing but old-fashioned Texas values and his Christian faith to guide him."
POLITICS_GERALD_L_K_SMITH:0 "For decades thought to be a follower more than a leader, Gerald Smith has come onto his own after joining the Huey Long’s American Union State in 1937 while on the evangelical circuit. An ordained Minister in his early life, Smith first came under the influence of Huey Long's Share Our Wealth society. Smith however migrated to the far-right portion of the AFP. Smith had continued to serve under Long, and despite their numerous disputes, he has managed to secure his position as Huey Long’s Successor. Now that he is in charge, there is little doubt that the AFP will migrate further right."
POLITICS_EARL_KEMP_LONG:0 "Once denied the Lieutenant Governor's post by his brother Huey Long in 1932, Earl Long has long lived in his brother's shadow. Earl was known in Congress for his progressive policies, but also for supporting the AFP's authority over state government. As the pre-determined successor to Huey Long years before his death, Earl displays the same reformist agenda, but with a more socially conservative and indulgent touch. It is under Earl Long that Huey Long's eduction and welfare reforms were really put into practice during those tense years. Whispers of Earl's racist remarks and of mental instability are covered up by the AFP."
##Constitutional American Republic##
POLITICS_WILLIAM_JOSEPH_SIMMONS:0 "Once, the Ku Klux Klan was as good as dead. Nothing but a fraternal organization from long ago. However, things change. The film “The Birth of a Nation” injected new lifeblood into the KKK, painting them as a heroic force protecting the white race. The KKK was to be reborn, and Simmons was to head this revived Klan. As America deteriorated, the Klan sided with Murray and the Constitutional American Republic and grew as a significant internal faction. Now, with Murray gone the Klan and the National Democratic White League has taken power, and  Simmons will shape America in his radical vision. "
POLITICS_WILLIAM_H_MURRAY_DESC:0 "William Henry Davis Murray, better known as “Alfalfa Bill” has quite the life under his belt. Born on a farm in Texas, little would expect that Murray would end up where he is today, his life being unremarkable for the first years of his life. His first introduction into politics was as a campaigner and in a failed run for Senate. However, Murray took to politics, being a skilled orator and lawyer. Through alliances, he rose through the political ranks until he was elected Governor of Oklahoma. This sent him to the forefront of national politics and pitted him against Garner and the “Moderate” Democrats. Eventually, Murray split from the traditional Democrats and founded the “Old Democrat Party”, which gained support from the Far-Right all across America. Now, President Murray must fight for his allies, for America, and for the White Race. "
POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSEL_DESC:0 "Born in Winder, Georgia on November 2nd, 1897 to a wealthy family, Richard Russel Jr. is fairly young. Russel began his career as a Democrat, and has stayed true to that party even through the rise of the Old Democratic Party under Alfalfa Bill Murray. However, his meteoric rise in Georgia politics has meant that he is at the center of the new Constitutional American Republic. Beginning as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives and then making his way to the position of governor, he became the most powerful man in the state. However, he only served as governor for two years, vacating his post to run for the U.S. Senate instead. He was succeeded as governor by Eugene Talmadge, a fiery orator whose Old Democratic leanings have put him at odds with Russel. Indeed, the two man have develeoped a bitter rivalry over the past few years, the culmination of which occurred in the 1936 election, in which Talmadge challenged Russel for his senate seat. Talmadge, articulating a powerful racial message, lost to the more economically focused Russel, but their rivalry is stronger than ever. Regardless, because the capital of the Constitutional American Republic is in Atlanta, Richard Russel has had considerable influence over the Constitutional American Republic, despite his status as a Democrat. His beliefs are more in line with Murray than the beliefs of Talmadge or many other Old Democrats, and the two have recently developed a sort of friendship. Russel wholeheartedly agrees with Murray's slogan of fighting "Corporations, Communism, and Miscegenation", despite his aristocratic background. In fact, Russel has always been a populist in both rhetoric and policy, always legislating for the sake of his people, not the wealthy. Now that he leads the nation, he must outthink the enemies who surround him at every turn while also finding a way to save his country. Clever politican and genuine populist that he is, he is perhaps the one man who can achieve these goals."
POLITICS_EUGENE_TALMADGE_DESC:0 "Eugene Talmadge was born on Sep 23th 1884 in Forsyth, Georgia. Going to the University of Georgia’s law school and being a part of groups such as the Sigma Nu fraternity, Talmadge began his pursuit for a political career. Running multiple times for Georgia's state legislature and losing, Talmadge became a democratic commissioner for the state’s agriculture. Despite these seeming failures, Talmadge made full use of spreading his rhetoric and influence among Georgia’s rural population. Utilizing his popularity, he eventually won the candidacy for Georgia’s governorship. Only joining the Old Democratic Party in ‘36, he made sure to sweep Georgia up in a tide of rhetoric once the civil war began, starting a wave of southern pride not seen since the civil war. While within the politics of the Old Democrats, Talmadge was not trusted with his late entrance to the party, and with the establishment seeing him as an extremist with his support for even further segregation and racial laws. Despite this seeming uphill battle, Talmadge seemed to convince Murray with his rhetoric as Murray assigned him as his successor. Now in charge of the nation, Talmadge has full reins to change the country as he sees fit."
COR_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "James Strom Thurmond was born on Dec 05, 1902 in Edgefield,South Carolina. Thurmond has served a variety of jobs, From farmer to teacher and coach, before becoming a Judge for his hometown. Forming populist rhetoric at seeing the poor conditions these career’s were going through during the depression, Thurmond eventually rose to the South Carolina Senate. Serving as a staunch segregationist yet still firm populist, Thurmond was among the Old Democrats throughout his young politician years. Throughout the Civil War Thurmond remained with the ODP,  constantly gaining support for the war effort with his charismatic fervor and gaining the eye of Murray for his support of the cause. Although they were somewhat split ideologically with Strom’s support for welfare, Murray propelled him forth in a surprise move when he designated him his successor. Now in charge of the Nation, Strom Thurmond must fight for his promises of welfare for the common man in an establishment that is still uncertain of the Young populist leader."
POLITICS_JOHN_RANKIN_DESC:0 "John E Rankin was born on March 29th, 1882 in Itawamba county, Mississippi. Going to Law school in Mississippi, Rankin eventually got elected to congress as a Democrat from it’s first district. Serving multiple terms in congress, it wasn’t until the eventual instability of the Great Depression that Rankin, Murray and other southern Democrats formed the Old Democratic Party. Serving as a part of the establishing ODP members, Rankin eventually got selected as Murray’s Vice president in the 1936 elections. Continuing to be Murray’s right hand man, he served faithfully, as his uncharismatic yet loyal nature proved him to be a good workhouse in the politics of the Constitutional American Republic. Now with Murray out of the picture, Rankin is the head of the government as his successor. How he will run the nation is yet to be seen, as so far it seems he will stick to the establishment and Murray’s previous ideals."
POLITICS_GEORGE_PATTON_DESC:0 "George Smith Patton, popularly called "Old Blood and Guts", was once a rising star in the U.S. Army, but his fortunes changed rather quickly. Now, Patton heads the army of the Constitutional American Republic, fighting to save the country from syndicalists, populists, and any other traitors who decide to show their ugly faces. Officially a member of the ODP, Patton has never liked politics much, but most of "Alfalfa" Bill Murray's views were in line with his own, and the two developed a friendship. From the beginning, Murray was quick to recognize Patton's talent, and he made him one of his top advisors. Now that Patton leads the party, he plans to leave most of the day-to-day administration work to his vice president and cabinet, opting instead to try and place the country on the road to recovery through guts, discipline, and hard work. This road is sure to be a hard one, as Patton believes this battle, like any other, will be lost as soon as the initiative is gone. As such, the American people will be pushed hard, but Patton aims to set an example by working hard himself, barnstorming the country with inspirational speeches designed to restore morale. Although he is an outspoken racist and a conservative through and through, Patton is different from his fellow politicians in that his focus is on America, not the South, and he has no love for the proposals of the Ku Klux Klan or the Fordists. He is instead expected to take a more moderate approach to politics, more in line with Murray. His foremost concern is to keep the old America alive, an America there was no such thing as a coward, and he plans to pursue this goal with much enthusiasm."
POLITICS_CHARLES_LINDBERGH:0 "Charles Lindbergh, or Lindy, was once the most famous pilot in America. Lindbergh's fame grew well into the 1920s in service of the US Air Mail Service. This coupled with a knack for improving planes that eventually grew into a business made Lindbergh even more famous. Lindbergh's association with the AFP starting in 1932, and escalated until he made contact with the War Power Committee. Eventually picked out of the Committee to be their next leader, Lindbergh intends to continue Murray's racialist positions and to encourage industrial innovations through example."
POLITICS_DC_STEPHENSON_DESC:0 "Nobody in their right mind would predict that David Curtiss Stephenson would ever lead America. His attempts with politics all failing miserably. But even though politics failed for him, Stephenson would still achieve power through the revived Ku Klux Klan, joining and rapidly rising through the ranks of the Indiana Klan. Eventually he would become Grand Dragon of Indiana, and command terrifying amounts of power in the Midwestern United States. As the Klan grew in power nationwide, so did the list of Stephenson’s enemies. Stephenson was the victim of numerous assassination attempts. These assassination attempts, along with Wilson’s softer hand on the Klan lead to Stephenson avoiding meaningful consequences for his actions. As America collapsed, the Klan and the NWDL sided with the CAR, and with the death of William J. Simmons, Stephenson is the man now poised to lead America into the future. "
POLITICS_HIRAM_WESLEY_EVANS_DESC:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans is a man who cares little for anything but power. The first parts of his life were relatively unremarkable, growing up as a normal child in Alabama and eventually moving to Texas where he became a dentist. However, Evans had massive ambitions and speaking skills to match, and with his admission into the Ku Klux Klan his path to power was becoming apparent. Even though he was not opposed to Lynching’s and even took place in them, he became vehemently opposed to them as he feared that they would give the Klan a bad image. Through the years, Evans grew to be in the highest echelons of Klan leadership, eventually becoming poised to take over upon the death of William J. Simmons. Now in charge, he promised reforms without selling out to Liberals or Socialists. Though, many comment that he cares little for ideology, only money and power. "
POLITICS_HERBERT_W_ARMSTRONG_DESC:0 "Herbert W. Armstrong, the Apostle of Christ. The black sheep of the NWDL leadership, little would have predicted that he would have been the one to succeed Simmons as leader of America; yet here he is. His early life was influenced by the church, his lengthy study of the bible beginning after a challenge from his wife to find proof that Sunday was the Sabbath. As his fanaticism grew, god himself began to influence him, opening his mind to new truths not accepted by the masses. Soon enough he began his own church and began broadcasting his sermons on the radio, something that garnered him a large following.  As America collapsed, Armstrong Denounced Reed and Long as the Beast and False Prophet and declared his allegiance to the Constitutional American Republic. And with a power struggle that ensured after the death of the American Emperor, Armstrong took the reigns of America. Under his watch, America will truly be God’s land."
POLITICS_FRANCIS_PARKER_YOCKEY_DESC:0 "Francis Parker Yockey, an up-and-coming member of the Young Klan, has led a coup against Herbert W. Armstrong. Yockey, though young, has taken inspiration from various spiritual and political figures in Europe who call for the erasure of the Enlightenment and Liberal values that characterized the previous century. Instead, Yockey hopes to establish a new age of authoritarian rule in America, which he views as the bastion of old values. To help him achieve this goal, he hopes to eliminate the power of the worst "Culture Distorting" and "Cultural Parasite" groups, namely racial and religious minorities in the country. Concurrent with this goal is the wider aim of unifying the Western world into an Imperium of Europe, which Yockey believes is the only way to save his people from certain destruction. To save the West, Yockey will become the ultimate authority over a united European and American civilization, and through the success of this task, we will finally have peace. Though this will be no easy task, Yockey's pragmatism and willingness to work with unlikely allies makes what seems to be an impossible goal into an ambitious but desparate attempt to save the world."
POLITICS_GEORGE_LINCOLN_ROCKWELL_DESC:0 "George Lincoln Rockwell, the young but idealistic leader of the Young Klan, has successfully wrested control of the country from Herbert W. Armstrong. Rockwell, unable to tolerate Armstrong's policies, has his own plans for the country at large. He hopes to reorganize society under what he believes to be the laws of nature, or the tribe. Further, he believes himself to be the true embodiment of the values of the Founding Fathers, and he fully intends to carry out their will in establishing an authoritarian state to maintain order and cleanse the country of its old corruption. An avid nationalist, Rockwell intends to separate minority groups who do not fit within the colonial definition of an American. Through these means, America will be a country for its own citizens once more, and the invasion of outside groups will be turned back. To accomplish these goals, Rockwell plans to use a robust media and propaganda apparatus that takes advantage of his own charisma as well as the passion of his followers to demonstrate the necessity of their actions. It will not be an easy road to free America from its shackles, but Rockwell believes he has just what he needs to rouse the American people from their slumber and call them to final action against those who would see them destroyed."

## Argentina ##
POLITICS_CARLES_DESC:0 "Manuel Carles began his political career when joined the Union Civica Radical 1898, which had been gaining popularity as it had recently been formed, back in 1891. He then climbed through the ranks of the party until he managed to become a national deputy for the province of Santa Fe in the national congress. He was assigned in 1918 by his colleague, president Hipólito Yrigoyen, as 'Interventor' of the Salta province, starting a long record of interventions by said government. His methods granted him enough experience to be allowed to become a teacher in the 'Colegio Militar de la Nacion' and the 'Escuela Superior de Guerra'.\n\n With the unoficial formation of the 'Liga Patriotica' during the 'Semana Tragica', Carles began making contact with the organisation, which was officially born in 1920 with Carlés as its leader. The organisation then began promoting the persecution of jews, anarchists, socialists and foreigners that refuse to integrate to the local Argentinean culture, and with the growing unrest, he began scheming his takeover, backed by many within the navy and a few army officers. With his coup d'etat now being succesful, he now sits in the 'Casa Rosada' in Buenos Aires, but his regime has not yet been recognized by the other provinces. Whether he'll be able to secure power and accomplish his promises of expansion and prosperity remains to be seen..."
POLITICS_DOMINGO_PERON_DESC:0 "Juan Domingo Perón, having grown up in the rural Patagonia, entered the 'Colegio Militar de la Nación' In 1911 thanks to a scholarship paid by Antonio M. Silva, a close friend of his grandfather. Despite becoming a national fencing champion, which turned him into a celebrity for the oligarchy, he's hardly had any relevant political position in his life, but the FOP's secession from Argentina has caused him great concern. After a short trip to Europe, he has changed his point of view regarding politics, and has returned to Argentina motivated by a will to help the working men of the country and take the nation to new heights. Now, with many in the lower classes, the trade unions and even in the Oligarchy desiring Peron's leadership, it remains to be seen if he will truly be able to achieve his promises..."
POLITICS_ALICIA_JUSTO_DESC:0 "Alicia Moreau de Justo was born in 1885 in the city of London, England. Her father, Armand Mureau, was a member of the French Paris Commune during the 1871 uprising and Her family was forced to move to Argentina in 1890. She met Hipólito Yrigoyen, who was professor of moral and civic instruction in her school, where they kept a friendly relation, with Yrigoyen beggining to inspire the young woman towards political activism. In 1906 she founded the Argentinean Feminist Movement, joining the Socialist Party and later entering the 'Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Buenos Aires' in 1907, where she graduated as a Physician a few years later.\n\nHowever, with the Great War raging on and the anarchist uprisings, her views began to conflict with the more radicalized Baldomeristas in the PS. As the Red Scare ran through the nation, she was forced to go underground until very recently. Always valuing democracy and pacifism, now Mureau has managed to become Head of State, where she is bound to try to take the country towards her vision of a new, equal and peaceful Argentina."
POLITICS_PABLO_RAMIREZ_DESC:0 "Pedro Pablo Ramirez went to military school at a young age, even managing to serve in the German Army until 1913. He was one of the most active members of the 1930 Uriburu's coup d’état, and was his head of the information service of the general staff until Uriburu's death in 1932. While not a direct member of the GOU, his son is one of the founders, granting him a wide array of military and political contacts that he can use if the situation requires it.\n\nNow that Ramirez has managed to become Head of State, he shall rule Argentina with an iron-fist, trying to enforce the discipline, nationalism and faith in Catholicism he was taught to the Argentinean society at large. However, it remains to be seen if his connections within the GOU are enough to stay in power if he ever manages to deviate from their vision for Argentina..."
POLITICS_JOSE_TAMBORINI_DESC:0 "Jose Pascual Tamborini joined the 'Union Civica Radical' when he was still in highschool. He was one of the mediators between the workers at the 'Taller Vassena' and the national authorities, where he failed to successfully reach a compromise, which lead to a major crackdown in the events leading up to the dreaded 'Semana Tragica'. His party didn't fare much better, as the increasing authoritarianism of Yrigoyen began splitting the party into the old 'UCR' and the new 'Union Civica Radical Antipersonalista'.\n\nTamborini joined the latter while he was minister of the interior during Marcelo T. de Alvear's presidency. In 1935 he was chosen as national deputy, and his political experience has managed to allow him to get enough support to run for presidency. Now that he's head of state, it falls to him to bring about the reforms that Leandro N. Alem, founder of the 'UCR' back in 1891, had envisioned for Argentina, and end once and for all the corrupt practices that have plagued Argentinean democracy!"
POLITICS_ROBUSTIANO_COSTAS_DESC:0 "Robustiano Patrón Costas graduated from highschool in 1895 and by 1900, he had graduated the 'Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Sociales de Buenos Aires' as a Lawyer with a PhD in jurisprudence, accomplishing one of his father's last wishes before he died. Robustiano took over his father's company, 'Patrón Hermanos' and then went on to become involved in Salta's Politics until he was elected governor of the same province between 1913 and 1916 with an independent party. His government in that province was characterized by great political stability and financial balance, and became one of the first provinces to fully embrace the Saenz Peña law.\n\nIn 1932, with the death of Uriburu and the upcoming elections, he formed among other independent leaders the 'Partido Democratico Nacional', where he was chosen as head of the party. Now that Robustiano has managed to achieve presidency, his entrepreneurial spirit, fiscal responsibility and compromise skills will surely usher in a new age of economic prosperity for Argentina."
POLITICS_NICOLAS_REPETTO_DESC:0 "Nicolas Repetto graduated as physician from the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' with plenty of experience in surgery thanks to an European internship which lasted until 1897. He was very active in politics from a young age, participating in the 'Revolucion del Parque' in 1890. Afterwards, he founded with his friend, Juan B. Justo, the 'Diario del Pueblo', one of the first socialist newspapers in Argentina. In 1900 he finally decided to affiliate to the 'Partido Socialista' which Justo had helped found, and then both founded the cooperative 'El Hogar Obrero' in 1905.\n\nAfter the death of Juan B. Justo, he became the obvious candidate of the now more moderate Partido Socialista, but didn't manage to win the 1932 national elections. Now that he has managed to become president, he'll strive to turn Argentina away from the exploitative practices of the past and into a better, more egalitarian tomorrow."
POLITICS_HIPOLITO_YRIGOYEN_DESC:0 "When Juan Hipólito del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Yrigoyen finished high school, he began his political career when he assisted Alem in the creation of the Union Civica, and when it subsequently split during the Roca regime, he continued assisting his uncle with the Union Civica Radical. He kept climbing through the ranks of the party until becoming his uncle right-hand man and participating in the 'Revolución del Parque' as one of the main instigators. However, Alem's suicide became a hard hit for the UCR, and an even harder hit for Yrigoyen, who temporarily retired from politics until 1904, working as a teacher in the meantime.\n\nHe then reorganized the UCR in 1904 and managed to get one of his friends, Roque Sáenz Peña, elected as President in 1910, and even becoming President himself from 1916 to 1922. He pushed for progressive reforms and tried to normalize the Argentinean electoral system, even intervening in provinces that were under the control of wealthy elites. He even began granting workers better work laws and began negotiating with many strikers. However, British pressure forced him to begin the crackdowns that lead to the 'Semana Tragica', and the events that subsequently created the FOP.\n\nHis increasing authoritarianism lead to factionalism in the UCR and the subsequent split of the UCRA, and when he was re-elected in 1938, where his antagonizing position against the army and the local elites caused the Uriburu's 1930 coup, where he was banned from politics. Now that he's president again, he'll finish the reforms that he started in 1928 and will try to bring about his uncle's vision of a strong and democratic Argentina."
POLITICS_JOSE_PETER_DESC:0 "Jose Peter, like many other 'Gauchos' from rural areas, was forced to move to the big cities in search of work, more specifically to the city of Zarate in 1923. His first political experience was in 1927, when he signed up with the 'Sindicato de Frigorificos de Zarate', where he helped create the 'Federación Obreros de la Industria de la Carne' with other trade unions of Zarate and Berisso.\n\nWhen Uriburu came to power, he was sent to the Ushuaia penitentiary after organizing a successful strike where he demanded the company 'River Plate de Zarate' to pay their worker's wages which had been delayed for two months. Now that he's free and in control of Argentina, he'll make sure to provide justice for the workers from the exploitation of the bourgeoisie."
POLITICS_ANGEL_BORLENGHI_DESC:0 "Angel Borlenghi became involved in politics with the local socialists of Pompeya's neighbourhood at a very young age, joining the 'Gremio de Empleados de Comercio'('Trade Employees Syndicate') and the Socialist Party as soon as he came of age. Unlike the leadership within the Socialist Party, he liked to keep direct contact with the workers, which gained him a lot of support among the trade unions. Despite having an illustrious performance within the 'CGT' ('Central General del Trabajo'), he never managed to climb up the ranks within the Socialist Party.\n\nAfter Uriburu's coup and the subsequent crackdowns on anarchist, syndicalists and socialists, he was arrested and taken to the Ushuaia penitentiary. Now that he's free and sits within the 'Casa Rosada', He'll use his connections within the Trade Unions to lead Argentina to a better tomorrow with the worker's consent."
POLITICS_ARTURO_FRONDIZI_DESC:0 "Arturo Frondizi was a strong supporter of the UCR and a defender of democracy when Yrigoyen managed to win the presidency, but refused to participate in any sort of political activity. However, Uriburu's coup forced him to change his point of view regarding democracy, where he even refused attending his own graduation ceremony which Uriburu would attend to give him an Honor Diploma in Law.\n\nHe was arrested in a democratic demonstration in 1931. This very detention has made Frondizi decide to leave his work as a law professor and begin a career as a politician. At the end of 1932, he was arrested at another rally, and when he was released he joined the UCR.\n\nHe has since then joined a faction within the UCR that considers the approach of Marcelo T. de Alvear to be too conservative, and he has made promises to bring more progressive reforms to Argentina and return to the economic policies Yrigoyen enacted. Now that he sits in the 'Casa Rosada', it remains to be seen if he'll be true to his word."
POLITICS_RICARDO_BALBIN_DESC:0 "In 1922, when he became 18, Ricardo Balbín joined the UCR and moves to La Plata, where local political activism drove him to sign up in the 'Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata', where he graduated as a lawyer in 1927, but hardly ever using his title as he has since then fully committed to his political career.\n\nHe was chosen as provincial deputy in 1932 and 1940, however, he resigned his last post in condemnation to the fraud that plagued local elections. He has since then left the UCR and joined the more moderate 'Partido Democrata Nacional', where he has promised to bring an end to the corruption that plagues Argentinean society and finally usher in a new era of prosperity."
POLITICS_ROBERTO_ORTIZ_DESC:0 "Roberto Marcelino Ortiz signed up into the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' to study medicine, but he was forced to change his career to Law due to a strike from the students’ centre which caused the medicine section to be closed down temporarily. He affiliated the UCR and participated in the failed 1905 revolution. When the UCR split, he joined the UCRA and became public works minister for Marcelo T. de Alvear.\n\nDespite his support for the democratic process, he supported Uriburu's coup, although he despised Uriburu's economic policies. After the Carlés coup, Ortiz has become convinced that the political corruption in Argentina has to end once and for all if democracy is ever to survive in Argentina, and will endeavour all of his efforts from the 'Casa Rosada' to strengthen the democratic process and end local corruption, with intervention if needed."
POLITICS_EDELMIRO_FARRELL_DESC:0 "Born to an Irish migrant family, Edelmiro Julian Farrel enrolled in a military school and graduated in 1907. While no one doubts of his military ability and personal charisma, he was never prepared to be a politician. Now that the role of presidency has been thrusted upon him after overthrowing Ramirez, he has become a mere puppet of the GOU's control over the country. He relies mostly on his vice-president, Juan Domingo Peron, to do most of the political work, where Farrel only ever appears in public ceremonies and signs public documents in the name of the GOU."
POLITICS_MARCELO_ALVEAR_DESC:0 "Alvear became involved in politics at a young age, helping organize a meeting in Jardin Florida which would lead to the 'Revolución del Parque', after which he became secretary for Leandro N. Alem. He continued serving Alem until his suicide, after which he left to France for a time and got married. He was elected deputy between 1912 and 1916 without even residing in the country, forcing him to return to Argentina during the Sáenz Peña regime, after which he became Argentinean ambassador to France, even donating a large amount of wealth for the construction of frontline hospitals.\n\nHe was elected as president from 1922 to 1928, where he tried to reduce the FOP's influence in Argentina at large by granting better rights for workers in the country, although he had kept a hardline stance towards the FOP, mostly due to militaristic influences in his staff. Like his predecessor, Yrigoyen, he tried to intervene provinces that had their elections rigged by wealthy local elites, but his methods polarized the UCR and the UCRA even more. Nevertheless, his progressive social, educational and economic reforms have left a positive impression in the Argentinean people, and now that he's been re-elected as president, he'll try to re-enact and continue the reforms for which he stood for in his first presidency."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_DE_ANDREA_DESC:0 "Miguel de Andrea began his career after being ordained in 1899 by the Bishop of La Plata, Juan Terrero. He climbed steadily the ranks of the church until becoming the Head Priest of the San Miguel de Arcangel Church, and being named director of a Social-Christian Trade Union, the Circulos Obreros Catolicos, after the death of its founder, Federico Grote. However, unlike his founder, Miguel de Andrea took a hardline stance against the rising anarchist movements growing in the city of Buenos Aires, and as such quickly found himself alligning with the Liga Patriotica, taking part in their rallies and putting them into contact with the most reactionary sectors of the Argentinean branch of the Catholic Church.\n\n However, his views never alligned with the league, and he found himself coinciding more with the Portuguese Integralists who catered to his anti-liberal, ultra-catholic and Corporatist mindset. While originally skeptic of a Brazilian victory, he quickly abandoned the Liga Patriotica as the defeat seemed imminent, and began pushing his contacts in the Brazilian church in order to proclaim his loyalty to the Integralists. Without any solid military or civilian leaders willing to obey Brazilian commands, Miguel was chosen as the provisional President of Argentina until a more stable government can be settled in favour of the Integralist doctrine, which Miguel believes will finally bring faith in God, the Church and the government back to the workers."

POLITICS_LALA_LAJPAT_RAI_DESC:0 "Lala Lajpat Rai, Punjabi Hindu philanthropist, returned from championing Indian independence in the United States to formulate the creation of a new socialist state in India. With the collapse of British rule in late 1925, Rai, along with other Indian socialist figureheads, proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Bengal. While the People's Republic initially failed to unite India through force, it managed to consolidate its rule over the northeastern third of the sub-continent. Rai, once relatively secure in his leadership of the People's Republic, renamed the Bharatiya Commune to indicate its ambition of unification, now faces spirited opposition from competing socialist factions. With his advanced age and waning influence, Rai has announced his intent to resign from his post. His successor may well determine the future of the Commune itself."
POLITICS_FAZLUL_HUQ_DESC:0 "Fazlul Huq, former secretary of the Bengali Muslim League, and now an avowed Syndicalist, has led his 'Moderate' faction to victory in the Indian National Congress's special session. He campaigned on a platform of trade-union centric industrialisation and the gradual implementation of socialist reform. Despite electoral success, however, Fuq still faces staunch opposition from opposing factions of the Indian National Congress. Regardless, Fuq's vision of prosperity in the historically impoverished eastern India, and perhaps one day the entire sub-continent, appears, at least to his supporters, to be increasingly achievable."
POLITICS_CHANDRA_BOSE_DESC:0 "As a boy, Subhas Chandra Bose once assaulted a British schoolmaster for defaming his beloved India; his expulsion thereafter left Bose with an almost rabid desire for vengeance. Shortly before the collapse of the British Raj, Bose attracted large swaths of the Indian population to the socialist cause with incendiary speeches against the all who would deny India's people sole dominion over the sub-continent. With the success of Bose's Maximists within the Indian National Congress, the Bharatiya Commune as a whole has begun to assume a similarly militaristic outlook; it now looks to strike a decisive blow to the hearts of the Dominionists and Princely Federation alike."
POLITICS_MOHANDAS_GHANDI_DESC:0 "A former lawyer, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi valued highly the gradual, peaceful, and lawful independence of India from British rule. With the collapse of the Raj, however, he and his many followers were forced to reassess their position. Though still a proponent of pacifism, Ghandi has become increasingly influenced by the ideas of his colleagues in the now radicalised Indian National Congress. Ghandi's victory in the Indian National Congress's special session has awoken renewed hope for the peaceful reunification of the Indian sub-continent and the reconciliation of its divided factions."
POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC:0 "Jawaharlal Nehru is almost certainly the most tactful of the Bharatiya Commune's prominent political leaders. With the collapse of the British Raj, Nehru, while a staunch advocate for immediate independence from the weakened Empire, worked tireless to mediate all manner of disputes among Indian leaders across the political spectrum. While his detractors would slander Nehru as indecisive and cowardly, Nehru's subtle political manoeuvring was essential for his ascension to the highest levels of the Indian National Congress, and now the Bharatiya Commune itself. Under Nehru's leadership, perhaps the factionalism which has plagued the Congress for decades may finally be assuaged."
POLITICS_NIRMAL_KUMAR_BOSE_DESC:0 "Nirmal Kumar Bose, protégé of the famous Mohandas Gandhi, has assumed leadership of the Bharatiya Commune. He is likely to continue the agrarian reforms of Ghandi, and encourage the non-violent reunification of India. Many dissidents within the Bharatiya Commune, however, are displeased with Bose's rise to power, believing, despite official explanations to the contrary, that Bose masterminded Ghandi's demise."
POLITICS_SHRIPAD_AMRIT_DANGE_DESC:0 "Shripad Amrit Dange is perhaps the most radical syndicalist within the Indian National Congress. Much like Nestor Makhno of the French Anarchistes, he advocates the eventual disestablishment of the very state itself. Unlike the Anarchistes however, rather than promoting rural collectivisation, Dange advocates industrialisation and the assumption by trade unions of the entire economic apparatus."

He entered the 'Colegio Militar de la Nación' in 1922, where he graduated in 1927 as second lieutenant, and steadily rose through the ranks until becoming captain just before the Chaco War. During the Chaco War, he was rewarded several times for bravery and is seen as a Bolivian war hero. With the defeat at the Chaco War, Busch allied himself with David Toro, and both couped the liberal government by Salamanca in 1934 with huge support from the army and the populace in general. Since then, Busch has been pushing reforms that have slowly but steadily improved the Bolivian situation, and the general populace holds him on high regard. However, Busch was never prepared to be a politician, and it remains unclear if he'd like to continue as President, or will finally call for elections once the situation normalizes."
POLITICS_VICTOR_PAZ_DESC:0 "Víctor Ángel Paz Estenssoro was born in 1907 in the town of Tarija, Bolivia. Víctor wanted to study civil engineering, but since that career wasn't available in Bolivian universities, he ended up choosing to study law at the 'Universidad Mayor de San Andrés', where he graduated as a lawyer in 1927, with just twenty years. When the Chaco War, Paz enlisted in the army, reaching the rank of sergeant a few months of having volunteered. During the war, he read the 'ABC of Communism' by Bukharin and the 'The Burning Question of Trade Unionism' by De Leon, which influenced Víctor towards syndicalist-leaning ideals. When the war ended, Paz served as a lawyer for a year for 'Patiño Mines', owned by the Tin King Patiño himself, where he witnessed the extent of the mining companies influence in Bolivian affairs. Outraged, he resigned and formed the 'Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario', trying to rally political moderates that wish to end the corrupt influence that private companies exercise on Bolivia's government. Now that he has managed to become President, Víctor will strive to bring about a land reform, nationalisation of key industries and better working conditions for all Bolivians."
POLITICS_ARZE_ARZE_DESC:0 "José Antonio Arze y Arze was born in 1904 in Cochabamba, Bolivia. He graduated as a lawyer from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Simón' in 1926, and then joined the 'Federación Universitaria Boliviana', where he began to be influenced by the Syndicalist ideals within the organisation. Arze y Arze, with other intelectuals of the organisation like Ricardo Anaya and Jose Cuadros Quiroga created the 'Programa de Principios', in which they stipulated that Bolivia had to nationalize the mining and oil industries, provide land for natives to work and enforce stronger work laws. However, José's radical anti-war posture forced him to leave for Chile when the Chaco War came about. He returned at the end of the war, and formed the 'Partido Sindicalista de Bolivia', gathering support from the exploited miners in the poorer areas of Bolivia. Now that Arze y Arze has managed to become President, he'll enact the 'Programa de Principios' and carry on further reforms to transform Bolivia into a revolutionary country."

Bernardino entered the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito' when he was 17, earning a scholarship for the Military Academy in Chile, where he graduated as an Infantry second lieutenant in 1918, and became a pilot in 1919. In 1926, already with the rank of Major, he founded the 'Escuela de Aviación de Bolivia', becoming a pioneer in Bolivian aviation. He became a national hero during the Chaco war, standing out for his bravery and excellent organisation skills. However, the defeat against the Paraguayans have drastically changed Bilbao Rojas political stance, leading him to form the Partido Nacionalista Boliviano.

He began working as an administrator in the 'Compañia Minera Huanchaca', then moving on to a trading company and finally working as miner in Huanchaca. He'd discover an extremely rich vein of tin in 1900, forming his own mining company to exploit it, and with the profits, he began buying over his competition. By 1924, Patiño already had already bought foundries in Canada and Germany, forming the 'Patiño Mines and Enterprises Consolidated Inc.'. He has used his vast wealth to influence Bolivian public affairs since 1929, using the Partido Liberal Popular as a façade to pass his reforms.

On his return to Bolivia, he joined the Partido Liberal, where he climbed through the party ranks until being chosen as deputy in 1916 and ambassador to Colombia in 1929, where he was fired for criticizing President Hernando Siles, and his criticism of the following governments led him to be exiled and even slapped by President Busch-Becerra in 1936. Thanks to the Partido Liberal Popular's influence, he was able to return to Bolivia for the 1940's election. He is a prolific writer, making several books and essays regarding the harsh Bolivian reality, and now that he has become President, he'll try to liberalize the inefficient Bolivian bureaucracy and help the common citizen have a better standard of living. However, the mining companies hold great influence on his party, and he may be forced to make concessions to said companies..."

POLITICS_OTAVIO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "Otavio made his politcal debut in 1908 at the contentious politics of the state of Bahia, and his rapid rise in notoriety gave him fame, and some exiles from the state as well. Said notoriety was enough for him to later become a State Representative in 1912. His staunch positions in favour of the late Washington Luis and João Pessoa during the times of civil helped to raise his profile to greater heights, and he was elected president of the State of Bahia in the elections organized there in 1928. Later, as consensus bid for the Brazilian Republican Party, his name was put foward for the position of President of the Republic, and was endorsed by then President João Pessoa. His presidency was very much a return to normalcy at first, but the rise of radical movements especially in the cities, and public order in general, is a rising concern. However, the good pace of economic and political recovery has ensured his popularity remains high, and it is possible that some of this popularity is why João Mangabeira, his brother, became a household name more left wing circles."
POLITICS_GUSTAVO_DODT_DESC:0 "Hailing from the Northeastern state of Ceará, Gustavo Dodt Barroso is one of the nation's most influential intellectuals and the leader of the Brazilian Integralist Action. While he's an accomplished author since age 23, his entry in the political arens came after watching a passionate speech about the values of Integralism by important figure, Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, in 1928. Ever since he has dedicated himself to helping push the movement's agenda, writing several well selling books on the subject, but also his own anti-semitic views, especially in the first translated copy of the Protocols of the Heirs of Zion in Brazilian Portguese, and also dedicates himself to poetry and studies of Brazilian folklore, which garnered him a seat at the Brazilian Academy of Letters. His profound nationalism and hatred of precieved foreign meddling made him gain especial disdain and hatred for Syndicalists in Brazil, whom he claims are French spies sent to establish a puppet republic."
POLITICS_GETULIO_VARGAS_BRA_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the border state of Rio Grande do Sul, Getúlio Vargas always had a knack for politics. Since his earliest forays into state politics, he always was a skilled navigator and, according to some, a shrewd manipulator. While he only entered politics in 1913, by the time of the Revolution of 27 he was already State President of his home province, and his diplomatic skill managed to both prevent intervention from foreigners and to ensure that Rio Grande do Sul sided against the Federal forces. After the war, Vargas became Vice President under João Pessoa, and became far more well known nation wide, taking time to appear in radio and other public adresses as a man ''looking out for the little guy'' while he could do so. Since Otávio Mangabeira took office, he spent four years articulating an energic presidential campaign. Always professing non extreme, but powerful views on the future of Brazil, Vargas believes that the only way the nation can truly enter the modern era is through and extensive campaign of industralisation, modernisation and rearmament, a process that he believes no person or law has any right to impede, for his intention is to always act with Brazil's best intentions first and foremost."
POLITICS_EURICO_DUTRA_BRA_DESC:0 "A Matogrossense general with the highest condecorations, Eurico Gaspar Dutra started his military career very early, and went to officer's academies at Rio Pardo, Rio de Janeiro, where he partook in the Vaccine Revolt and was later pardoned, and at Porto Alegre. Respected for his efforts during the Civil War and beyond, the officer has enough gravitas to pull together a haphardly government, which is more or less a dictatorship all but in name, to keep order in this time of extreme crisis. He has a very public disdain of Syndicalism and all forms and socialist and has personally overseen the crushing of several revolts of this nature over the past decade."
POLITICS_JULIO_PRESTES_DESC:0 "A representative of a powerful family in São Paulo, Julio Prestes debuted in the political arena in 1909 as a state representative in the parliament of São Paulo. He quickly distinguished himself, and even led troops into battle against mutinous military men twice before becoming a federal representative, where his liberal character gave him admiration from many. A friend and supporter of Washington Luís, Prestes was devasted by his sudden assatination and rallied behind the cause during the coming crisis and conflict, but was glad that it ended as quickly as it did. He gained renewed political vigour afterwards, and claims to be trying his best to uphold the legacy of his friend Washington. Following the defeat of Bahia's liberals in the previous elections, Julio found himself as an almost unanimous choice for candiate of the Liberal Party, and his victory again renewed his vigour to uphold the liberal and positvist principles he defended throughout his life, as the Liberals finally have a chance to make Brazil a truly free country."

POLITICS_ABILIO_NEQUETE_DESC:0 "An orthodox christian hailing from Lebanon, Abilio de Nequete is actually not his birth name, that being Abdo Nakt. He came to Brazil looking for his father, who had emigrated years earlier than him, in 1903, and reuinted with him shortly thereafter. However, soon their political differences put a wedge on their relationships, and later on  Abilio converted to Spiritism and joined union circles. Inspired by the revolutions in Europe, he joined the anarchist International Workers Union, but their militant atheism caused him and some other men to split off and form the Maximalist Union, a party that opposed their ideas in more matters than just religion. The Maximalist movement grew and garned much strength in Porto Alegre, but still he faced opposition from anarchist unions, who were still the majority in the city, but his influence grew with time. In recent years, he was influenced by other centralist socialists abroad, and his Maximalist Union was one of the many leftist movements to support the so called Democratic Left. He is well respected by most Syndicalists in Brazil, even if his scathing and combative personality got him kicked out of more than one meeting. To him, Brazil's many issues after a decade of chaos can only be solved by a firm hand and unity among the people, a view shared by many army and navy officers. However, anarchists are still the biggest opponents to him in the political arena."
POLITICS_MINERVINO_OLIVEIRA_DESC:0 "Like many of Brazil's poor, Minervino de Oliveira began to work as a child, and from his yearliest years of adulthood he already was an influential union member, and also was an early member of the Brazilian Syndicalist Party and contributed to leftist newspapers. By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defence of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key turning point in the electoral race, and he became nationally known after the endorsement, Thrusted into his new position by the first congress of trade unions, Mangabeira is the first black president and the first syndicalist to occupy the highest office in the country, and the nation holds its breath to see what will come to pass during the Oliveira government."
POLITICS_MACIEL_BRA_DESC:0 "A true captain of the old guard, Olegário his political career all the way back in 1880, and has not left the game since, even at his advanced age. While some opposition members claim that having a president with ''one foot on the grave'' is dangerous for Brazilian democracy, the three time state president of Minas Gerais' politcal power cannot be denied, even if his body fails him more and more frequently in the past few years, as with any man in his eighties. His long support of Vargas in the Republican Party can be seen as ideological similarities, as both see a united and proactive federal government as vital for a better Brazil, but their alliance is often seen as one of convenience between the most powerful politicians of two powerful states of the Union. While his platform during elections was mostly a repeat of Vargas's 10 years ago, the ''old man president'' doesnt really considers the southerner his sucessor, as he envisions Gustavo Capanema as the one to inherit his political legacy in Brazil as a whole."
POLITICS_BORGES_DE_MEDEIROS_BRA_DESC:0 "Few men alive had as much of an impact in Brazilian politics, and especially in the Rio Grande do Sul state, as Antônio Augusto Borges de Medeiros, known politically by his last two names. Starting his political career in the 1890s, he swiftly rose through the ranks and assumed the position of state president from 1898 to 1908 and from 1913 to 1926, and was at the centre of the innumerable political crises, revolts and intrigues in Rio Grande do Sul during the timeframe, while also steadily rising to national proimience. Considered by many a man of unparalleled charisma and integrity, Borges refused a judicial position early in his life, in 1892, to focus entirely on politics, and has always tried to strike a balance between his ideas for a progressive Brazil and the whirlwind of political forces in his country and state. Having positioned himself very publically in favour of São Paulo in 1927, his views on the integrity of the state's soverignty remain unchanged, as does his disdain for any centralizing overtures by the goverment in Rio de Janeiro. Now elected president at nearly his eighties, his positivist beliefs are staunchier than ever, after the national-level schsim of the liberal party and a contested electoral race. While establishing a parliamentary majority and governing the large democracy is a challenge, Borges' gravitas and personal charm will no doubt play an important role in keeping the republic on the way to progress" 
POLITICS_PRESTES_MAIA_BRA_DESC:0 "Maia is not a politican by trade, but rather a civil engineer thursted to the position after his sucess in planning and reparing the infrastructure in São Paulo's most affected areas by the civil war, and his plan to completely remodel that state's streets has made great strides in the last decade, which made him the man of the hour in these elections. His beliefs clashed with other, older politicians and less liberally inclined members of the party, but his urban remodelling and subsequent tenure as Mayor of São Paulo made him well known nation wide, and thus he was picked to lead the splinter liberal ticket. His lack of political experience, especially at the national arena, may make his government quite the eventful affair, as his plans to remodel the country's fiscal and infrastructure systems may very well find stiff resistance in parliament, even with his own party's views. However, the fact that a man that isnt an establishment politician managed to enter the Catete is seen well by most of the populace"

While previously a member of the Liberal party, Nereu joined the Democratic Left during the last elections at the urging of Mangabeira, as to make sure that the party is not seen as dangerous leftist outsiders, and because his own frustrations at the apparent lack of changes after the crisis in 27.

POLITICS_CANDIDO_RONDON_HOS_DESC:0 "Almost a living legend in Brazil, Candido Rondon is a die hard republican who spent decades of effort to connect, explore and map the large western reaches of Brazil. Usually not one to meddle in political affairs, Rondon was shocked to find after an expedition that Brazil's ruling Integralist party was not only plotting to restore the monarchy, but also had seemingly ordered his arrest. He took up arms, and was joined by many across the country who loathed the monarchist and populist rethoric of the Integralists, but still was at a severe strategic disadvantadge. However, his knowldege of local terrain and lifetime of military experience, coupled with uprisings dividing the attention of the oversteched federal govermnent, allowed his revolution to succeed. Now he rules as interim president, leading a process of de-intoxicating Brazil from the monarchist disease until the next elections come, and law and order are properly restored to the nation. "

POLITICS_ISIDORO_DIAS_LOPES_DESC:0 "One of the many old and very respected Gaúcho officers in the Brazilian Army, also known for the monicker of ''Marshall of the Revolution'' recently, Isidoro Dias Lopes has a long history of siding with what he considers morally correct rather than what his superiors order him to. From 1893 in the Federalist Revolt in his home state to now the Chilean Crisis, his steady hand and respect by the people and officers granted him enough political capital to proclaim himself provisional president. Despite persistent requests by other officers, especially from those further to the right who see his moderate voice as needed, Isidoro has stated in no uncertain terms that his government is temporary, and he will step down as soon as the Union representatives and delegates meet to select a ruler. Time will tell if this decision is the right one for the future of the country."

POLITICS_JOAO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "João Mangabeira started out as a noteworthy defence attorney in Ilhéus, before turning to politics like his brother, former president Otávio. Early on in his career he was a close and passionate follower of Rui Barbosa, but after his mentor's passing, he carved a career of its own as a federal representative of the state of Bahia. A man with deeply rooted anti-authoritarian principles, he was a vocal supporter of Bahia's role in the civil conflict, and gained notoriety as a result. As his career went by, the continous and yet seemingly fruitless struggle of Brazil's poor brought him closer to the left, and while he certainly has some socialist views and allies in union and intellectual circles, he certainly is no Syndicalist. His plan for Brazil was to build a broad leftist front to oppose the current status quo, and his sucess was unexpected, but probably not unpredictable considering the social upheaval following Black Monday and the scandalous repression of labour movements nationwide. Now, he has to juggle the several disparate factions in his left front while keeping the ravenous opposition at bay, and it seems his presidency is certainly going to be as eventful as his brother's."

Having spent his childhood at Castle D'eu with the Imperial family in exile, he wasnt able to set foot in Brazil until the Decree of Banishment by the republic was revoked in the 1920s, even though he was deferred from serving in the armed forces in 1925. Having come to live permanently in Brazil after the civil war, which convinced him personally more than ever that a monarchy was needed by the people, he immediatly started to articulate politically towards his restoration, and his scheme has finally come to fruition as he has been crowned Pedro III of Brazil. He has been prepared all his life, from childhood tutors to lessons as an adult, for this station he considers his birthright, but few things could prepare a man for the tumultous times since Black Monday shattered the economic order of the world. While he certainly is thankful for the assitance of the Integralist movement in restoring him, his views towards the more radical wings of the party are not as positive as one could think, as their extreme views often clash with his milder ones."

## Western Command Center ##
USA_OMAR_BRADLEY_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Born in 1893 to an impoverished family, Omar Bradley grew up with a love for athletics and firearms. In fact, after a talented baseball career in high school, he was offered a spot in several professional teams, but he declined to pursue a future in the military. Bradley became a military instructor and eventually became acquainted with George Marshall, who described him as "quiet, unassuming, capable, with sound common sense". More recently, Bradley taught at West Point, then studied at the U.S. Army War College. Bradley has undergone a meteoric rise in rank in the various recent American crises; a shortage in the American military leadership means that he is one of the first men called upon to lead. His boss, George Marshall, once said that you could give Bradley a job and forget about it. Now though, he must perform the job of a lifetime: saving America from itself. Douglas MacArthur has assumed control of the country, and partly due to the animosity between the two men, partly due to his high rank, Bradley has been sent to lead Federal forces in the West. He will be assisted in this task by Dwight Eisenhower, a man who Bradley trusts and respects far more than MacArthur. This 'Western Command Center' will theoretically exist only so long as rebels exist; once they have are defeated, it will be reincorporated into the United States. However, if Douglas MacArthur fails to fulfill his promise of stepping down once the crisis is over, desperate measures may need to be taken to ensure the contiuation of democracy in America..."

POLITICS_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_DESC:0 "Born in 1890 to a family tracing its presence in America to the eighteenth-century, Dwight D. Eisenhower had an eventful childhood. He had many interests, but chief among them was a love for military history, inspired by his mother's history book collection. Eisenhower was eventually accepted into West Point, where he tried his hand at a variety of sports, though none would hold his love more than playing cards. Eisenhower met Omar Bradley, a man with whom he would develop a close friendship, at West Point, and the two have both progressed in the military since. Eisenhower's organizational abilities first shined in this period of his life, but they only became more apparent to all observers once he began to command men and units. He held the rank of major for sixteen years but continued gaining prestige and influence within the military, working with men such as George S. Patton, John J. Pershing, Fox Conner, Douglas MacArthur, and George Marshall. As for MacArthur, it seems that destiny, fate, or whatever else one decides to believe in has put these two men together. Eisenhower has served as one of MacArthur's top men, and though the two have had vehement disagreements, Eisenhower has downplayed that part of their relationship, noting that they have always had a good relationship. However, as the two fought over MacArthur's reaction to the Bonus March in 1932, so too have they fought over MacArthur's increasing involvement over politics. Eisenhower had publicly supported the Federal and MacArthurite lines, but they had argued behind the scenes. During the war, Ike was given joint control over Federal lands in the West with Omar Bradley as a general, a position he held even as enemies surrounded his men on all sides. Eisenhower worried that MacArthur would not relinquish his power once the Civil War was over, and it appears his fears were well founded. Despite this, Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower have restored democracy to America, though neither man fully trusts the government, and have kept some of their power in a bid to prevent future crises from emerging. Eisenhower is a war hero, and the American people love him; adults write adoring letters to him, and those who know him best challenge him to a game of bridge every so often. Children sing "I like Ike" on playgrounds and even the elderly have good things to say about him. For Eisenhower though, his work has only just begun."

## Black Belt Republic ##
BBR_WEB_DUBOIS_POLITICS_DESC:0 "From an early day, William Edward Burghardt Du Bois would fight for equality, fight against intolerance, and go to any means for his beliefs. He grew up in a small integrated community in Massachusetts and attended university and eventually became a professor. Du Bois was one of the founders of the NCAAP, and one of the leaders of the Niagara Group, a group that opposed Booker Washington’s Atlanta Compromise. However, this would be just a page in his lifelong fight for equality, as throughout he fought against Lynchings, Jim Crow laws, and other discriminatory practices. He used his prominence as an author to spread his message to the wider world, with many regarding his work as cornerstones in the fight for Civil Rights all across America. Yet as the nation fell apart, the civil rights dilemma fell on deaf ears to the establishment. And with the outbreak of Civil War, it became clear that equality would not be came by peacefully. As the Black Belt uprising took hold over the South, Du Bois took hold over the new state, and will now call upon his countrymen to fight for equality, justice and their lives. "
BBR_FATHER_DIVINE_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Even to his supporters, Reverend M. J. Divine comes off as a strange man, a man who claimed to be God Himself. Yet, despite all of his various eccentricities his Peace Party is now in charge of the Black Belt Republic, were he seeks to unite the nation under tolerance and peace. Little is known about his early life, with people only being able to guess at his date and location of birth, as well as his birth name. Throughout his life he was sentenced to prison many times, committed to mental asylums, and declared as a madman, though most of these arrests were on baseless claims. Yet he and his followers persevered, following Father Divine and his unique church around America, even as the nation collapsed. His charisma and style of preaching turning his congregation from a disorganized and small group of Black Patrons to a massive interracial congregation. And along with James F. Jones, he founded the peace party, the party that eventually took over the Black Belt Republic. Now he will lead his countrymen to the future, no matter what it may bring. "
BBR_CHARLES_YOUNG_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Charles Young was born into slavery yet would go on to free many from oppression. Young attended an all-white high school and graduated at the top of his class, then became a teacher himself before he became a cadet at West Point. While at West point, Young was faced with a slough of discrimination from his peers, yet despite it all he persevered and graduated. He later served with Calvary troops and in various National Parks across America. He was also sent as a Military Attaché to Haiti and Liberia. Young was close to being the first Black Man promoted to Brigadier General, but many white troops did not want to be outranked by an African American. Due to this, president at the time Woodrow Wilson vetoed his promotion; throughout the following years white officers attempted to deny Young his promotion. Throughout the rest of his life Young was faced with discrimination, and when his brethren rose up against oppression, Young was quick to offer his services to the new Black Belt Republic. Now, Young is in charge of the young state and will guide it forward under Rooseveltian and Americanist principles. "
BBR_ELIJAH_MUHAMMAD_POLITICS_DESC:0 "The Honourable Elijah Muhammad came from humble beginnings; he had little education, going to work in the factories after age 3. While living in Detroit, he attended rallies for various Black Nationalist organizations, including one with Wallace Fard Muhammad. He taught that African Americans could reclaim their culture and history through self determination, something that a young Elijah Muhammad agreed with considering his own struggles in the South. He became an ardent follower of Fard and his ideology. Eventually Fard turned leadership of the Detroit Chapter over to Muhammad, and had the organization renamed to the “Nation of Islam”. When Fard disappeared, Elijah Muhammad was quick to take leadership of the NOI. As America collapsed and the Black Revolt begun, Muhammad declared to his followers to rise up alongside them. And along with other Black Nationalists, he took over the young state. Now, he will ensure that Black America is gods land, and his people will never again be oppressed by the White Devil. "
BBR_MARCUS_GARVEY_POLITICS_DESC:0 "The Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey is one of the most fervent black nationalists around. The founder of UNIA has some reservations about the Black Belt Republic. But, seeing our willingness to pursue closer ties with Liberia, he has returned to claim the mantle of leadership for our young nation. A separatist at heart, Garvey hopes to create a Pan-African state. Even if he does accomplish this, he still hopes to retain the lands we have fought so hard for. He certainly will not give up the country to socialists, who he loathes more than almost anyone else. His ideology, fittingly termed "Garveyism", has caught on in the Black Belt Republic. Many of our citizens hope to migrate to Africa eventually, but this is a long term goal, and for now, there is still the issue of other American factions to contend with. "
POLITICS_DUSE_MUHAMMAD_DESC:0 "Duse Mohamad Ali is an Egyptian black nationalist who believes in the concept of a Pan-Africa. His mentor, George Wells Parker, has died and left his legacy to Ali, who promised to continue it. Their ideology of social nationalism has caught in the Black Belt Republic, and now Ali stands poised to make his long held dream come true. With the Hamitic League by his side, Ali will hold power for years to come, and one day, perhaps Africa will be free from outside control."

POLITICS_GEORGE_DESC:0 "The King-Emperor, as he styles himself still, has ruled for 26 years now, assuming control in 1910 over the vast British Empire, an Empire on which the sun could never set, but these past 26 years have been one tragedy after another for the King-Emperor- losing a war to his cousin, the death of his youngest son, John, and the final exile of the British monarchy to Canada, privately noted as "a frozen prison" by the King-Emperor. At last, it seemed as the sun had set on the British Empire, and a sense of hopelessness pervaded through to King George's once stoic nature. The years since 1925 have seen the King-Emperor's health grow steadily worse through a mixture of stress and depression, causing Prince Edward to assume more duties from the sick King (much to his chagrin)."
POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC:0 "Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC:0 "Prince Albert of Windsor, younger Brother of British king Edward VIII, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. Though ridiculed as a child for his noticeable stammer, Albert grew into a collected and dutiful man. While Canadians appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Canadian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With Edward occupied with the reconstruction of the recently reconquered Britain, Albert toils diligently to ensure that Canada is properly governed."
POLITICS_ROBERT_POPHAM_DESC:0 "Robert Brooke-Popham, a general of the royal flying core during the Weltkrieg, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. Brooke-Popham has always been an administrator above all else, and was essential in the establishment of the Royal Air Force as an independent branch of the British, and later Canadian, armed forces. With his appointment to Quartermaster General of the Canadian armed forces, materiel shortages fell and efficiency rose greatly. It was on this basis that king Edward, too occupied overseeing the reconstruction of the United Kingdom to govern Canada, appointed Brooke-Popham as Canada's first Governor-General since the British Revolution."
POLITICS_FREDERICK_BANTING_DESC:0 "Frederick Banting, renowned scientist, and the first man to identify insulin and its function, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. While a researcher may see an odd choice for Governor-General, Banting has been of great importance to Canada. With the turmoil wrought by the British Revolution, Banting was instrumental in facilitating the immigration of thousands of British intellectuals to Canada, and the subsequent reorganisation of Canada's military research apparatus. With king Edward's, busy supervising the reconstruction of Britain, decision to delegate the choice of Governor-General to the Canadian parliament, appointing such a public figure and veteran administrator as Banting was a sound choice."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VANIER_DESC:0 "Georges Vanier, French-Canadian general responsible for the mitigation of Anglo-Quebecois tensions following the British Revolution, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. Vanier is a grizzled veteran of both the battlefields of the Weltkrieg, where he lost his right leg, and the challenges of military administration alike. Vanier is an iconic symbol of duty to many Canadians, and as a French-Canadian himself, especially the Quebecois. Fluent in both French and English, and loyal to Canada foremost, Vanier was the logical choice for the Canadian parliament for the position of Governor-General when king Edward, busy with the reconstruction of Britain, chose to delegate the decision to them."

In 1891, his father was exiled for opposing President José Manuel Balmaceda. Despite his early opposition to the ruling authorities, he joined the Chilean naval academy in 1892. Exiled due to his socialist tendencies, he was chosen to perform a role as a liason in Great Britain, effectivelt just to keep him out of Chile. But there he took part in the Revolution, and during his exile, During the rule of President Ibañez Del Campo, Chile's economy worsened and in 1931 the country went bankrupt. Shortly after this, Ibañez was deposed when most of the army and navy mutinied, allowing for Grove's return to Chile and the proclamation of the Socialist Republic. His recent ascetion to the post of Chairman is one that clearly signals that both Military and Civil authorities in Chile consider conflict with Argentina nigh inevitable after years of support for the Patagonian rebels."

## Combined Syndicates of America ##
POLITICS_CSA_CENTRAL_COMITTEE_DESC:0 "The victory of the working class is the collective victory of all true Americans. The American people of old still coalesce around the Central Committee as did the founders around the Constitutional Convention, though our goals be more noble. Here the liberators of socialism debate the future of our nation, and factions that John Reed united now form under their own visions of the future."
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_FLYNN_DESC:0 "At a dusty underground socialist club in Harlem, Elizabeth Flynn's life as an advocate began. An early organizer for the IWW in New Jersey, Flynn felt the blunt of the political wrath against forming trade unions, and was arrested ten times. Flynn helped found the ACLU, which organized legal defence for strikers in the days before the International Labor Defence. In the leadup to the civil war, Flynn helped organize the Longshoremen strike of the West Coast. Flynn's wartime speeches to the Central Committee to encourage conscription made her stand out to the numerous conscientious objectors in the Committee. Ultimately Flynn was elected to lead America as a shocking dark horse candidate. Some thought it absurd that a woman would stand at the forefront of the revolution, but the rebel girl herself had been at the spearhead all along, fighting since the founding of the IWW and now ready to build up a socialist America of her dreams."
POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "Norman Thomas has seen the highs and lows of social stature, and has remained dedicated to socialism the entire way through. From a newspaper boy to Princeton magna cum laude to conscientious objector, he has seen much and more of the world, but his time as a minister was perhaps the most important. By then an advocate of christian socialism, he decided to run for office. Prior to the Civil War, he had served as New York City's Mayor, and then as the vice-presidential candidate of Jack Reed. Inspired by the writings of Edward Bellamy, Thomas pivoted his pacifism during the war into advocacy for socialists living in the Federal lands to resist conscription and even create utopian societies for themselves. After the war, he used the experience he gained and his close friendship to Jack Reed to catapult him to prominence in the country. Preaching on behalf of the Nationalists, he lead the democratic socialists to victory in the constitutional convention. With a heart of gold and unshakable morals, Norman Thomas has ascended to the presidency."
POLITICS_EARL_BROWDER_DESC:0 "Born in Kansas, in the year of 1891, Browder became a committed socialist age 16. His adherence to the socialist party of America was unshakable, and through an early friendship with William Z Foster, he became a syndicalist. As the years passed, the two men began to drift apart. While Foster favored an authoritarian form of syndicalism, Browder began to see more and more limits with the movement. The American revolution has according to him, proven that the same beliefs and strategies used in Europe cannot be applied to America. His new economic policy has been built with inspiration from Bolshevism, reinterpretations of Maximism, and plenty of original thought. Browder also intends to end the persistent trend of industrial unionism in Congress, and to pursue lecherous religious elements within the socialist state. Browder has never abandoned the socialist party of America, but with his new authoritarian position he intends to ensure that the party will never abandon him."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_FOSTER_DESC:0 "A radical labor organizer who spearheaded the syndicalist movement in America, William Z Foster has practically become a legend on the American left. His leadership in the strikes of the early 20th century and his commitment that the Socialist Party of America adapt Syndicalist policies has cemented him as one of its chief ideologies. His famous manifesto, "Toward Syndicalist America" has served as the guidebook for every aspiring Totalist in the country, containing Foster's culminated ideals for how to rebuild the nation of America into what it is today. With the recent victories of the Vanguard movement of the Combined Syndicates, Foster was uplifted to lead the new nation. Several of Foster's older, more socially ambitious ideas now come to the fore. This includes plans to reform the socialist human being as a whole, and to re-orient American morals towards the vanguard of socialism."
POLITICS_JAMES_CANNON_DESC:0 "Personally mentored by Big Bill Haywood and well versed in the struggles of the American left, James Cannon became an unshakable presence within the socialist party of America. Although initially a fanatic adherent to Bolshevism, the failure of the Russian revolution contrasted with the triumph of the French syndicalists made Cannon adopt a more libertarian view on socialism. As a formal representative of the SPA, he spent much time abroad in France and Britain, before returning to America after the outbreak of the civil war. Helping to organize foreign volunteers and the Internationale's advisers, he cemented his reliability as a brilliant administrator. With the war won, Cannon would immediately start to build the momentum needed to run for president, and has now finally fulfilled his ambition!"
POLITICS_CARLO_TRESCA_DESC:0 "Born to an impoverished family in Italy, Tresca's emigration to America became the first major step in a tumultuous life which saw him soon emerge as Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America. Having built up a famed reputation as an anarchist, a strike organizer and a community leader among Italian immigrants, Tresca became an integral figure within the IWW. His oratory and legal skills were put to use defending men such as Sacco and Vanzetti, as well as stopping the infiltration and manipulation of trade unions by the Italian Mafia. He spent much time vocally supporting the revolution in his homeland Italy, defending the merits, accomplishments and potentials of the Italian Socialist Republic to his fellow Italian-Americans. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Carlo Tresca played a key role in the takeover and new administration of New York City, he survived multiple assassination attempts and scores of protests against his campaign for being an Italian immigrant. His prior accomplishments within the Italian Socialist Federation and the IWW has now allowed Carlo Tresca to launch a successful campaign to become President."
POLITICS_ARTURO_GIOVANNITTI_DESC:0 "Born in Abruzzi Italy, Arturo was one of the hundreds of thousands who came to the United states seeking opportunity. Arturo instead found a ripe political climate for expanding workers’ rights. Arturo was there during the 1912 Textile Strike of Lawrence, Massachusetts, where his illegal arrest and subsequent trial in a metal cage became a rallying point for the New England IWW. Arturo was acquitted of all charges, and became a socialist activist, first opposing the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, then the US's entry into the war. During the revolution, Arturo led an Italian American brigade out of New England and into the CSA territory under hostile fire. A talent for speaking and poetry elevated his campaign. Ultimately he was elected President as a true citizen."
POLITICS_MEYER_LONDON_DESC:0 "Born in Tsarist Lithuania under the grip of Russian influence. Meyer's first ambition was to become a Talmudic scholar like his father. The adverse conditions of Russia forced Meyer's family to relocate to New York City, where Meyer became a printer. Printing for Yiddish publications, Meyer had fallen into one such group of radical intellectuals that encouraged him to become a lawyer. Starting in the 1890s, Mayer joined Eugene V. Deb's Social Democratic Party, and was a leading organizer of the 1910 New York Clockmakers Strike. A coalition ticket with Progressives allowed Meyer to become the first of many socialists in Congress. Meyer opposed the U.S's entry into the Weltkrieg, and yet aided the McAdoo administration in promoting militancy. Meyer even angered Jewish labor by promoting partisan Jewish organisations above Zionist labor groups. Meyer went undercover during the Crisis of 36, and re-emerged following the war championing many of the issues he was against. Meyer the pro-Zionist war hawk was much more popular, even against protesters claiming he couldn't run for President as an immigrant."
POLITICS_UPTON_SINCLAIR_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, in Baltimore, Upton was an aspiring author from an early age. In his teens he wrote pulp magazines and poetry to make a living, eventually moving into investigative journalism. His moment in the spotlight came after he spent seven weeks disguised as a worker in Chicago's meatpacking plants, drafting a political expose on the poor labor conditions of the plants. Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry, of which he declared "I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the "End Poverty In California" campaign. E.P.I.C as it came to be known was not the roaring triumph he had expected, but gave Sinclair enough fame and recognition that he could later pursue a second political career in the new America. Now championing a E.P.I.C movement applied nationwide, Upton Sinclair has won the recent presidential election with a startling margin."
POLITICS_FRANK_LITTLE_DESC:0 "Born to a family of Oklahoma homesteaders, Frank Little moved to California in order to escape the miserable droughts that had ruined his family's land. Him and his brother both became ministers, but in 1905 Frank became a full-time organizer for the IWW. A proud wobbly, he soon struck up a friendship with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and fought alongside her for the rights of unionized workers across the whole country. Frank narrowly survived two separate attempts at lynching by strike breakers, once in Wisconsin and a second time in Montana. Two instances of nearly being murdered caused Frank Little to lay low for several years, only beginning to show his face again around the mine wars of the early 1920s. His political activism was less provocative, and he avoided any more near-death experiences until the outbreak of the civil war. Although too hold to fight personally, Frank helped organize a series of militias across the Steel Belt, and was later nominated to serve in the new government. From this position, he could launch a campaign for the presidency, which the elderly union man narrowly won."
POLITICS_HARRY_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Harry Bridges was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1901. When he turned 15, he was first introduced to radical labor politics through the Australian branch of the IWW. Emboldened by his contacts with fellow socialists, along with seeing the general deplorable conditions of the poor around the world, he participated in his first general strike in Australia in 1917. Three years later, in 1920, he would move permanently to the US due to the more plentiful work there. He settled in San Fran where he joined other local activists in reviving the then-defunct International Longeshoremens Association. In 1934 a period of month-long negotiations between the twenty local branches of the ILA and the dock owners of SF broke down when two longshore workers were murdered. Bridges, the leading negotiator for the ILA during the standoff, convinced over 100 San Francisco unions to join together in a General Strike. The ILA fought the city to a standstill, and Harry Bridges was given credit for stopping further police violence. His later Presidential campaign often faced off against protesters who defied the new Amendment giving natural born citizenship to immigrants, and prevailed against them. Using this reputation, he launched a risky but successful campaigned that has lead him to the presidency."
POLITICS_FRANK_JOHNS_DESC:0 "Initially a carpenter from Oregon, Frank Johns became the leading figure of the regional Socialist Labor Party. Running twice for congress and twice for the presidency, Johns seemed doomed to a lifetime of obscurity as a fringe party candidate. That was until he went through a near death experience in 1928, nearly drowning in an attempt to save a young boy whom had fallen in a frigid river. Forced to retire from the Socialist Labor Party in order to recover from the incident, Johns was given enough time to think and plot out a new career. He began to correspond with several members of the Socialist Party of America, and after being released from the hospital he went on to join them as a fiery orator. Emboldened by his heroism and having narrowly avoided death, Johns later threw himself into the second American civil war as a capable and courageous militia leader. Thanks to his military accomplishments and personal reputation, he has now finally been elected president, of a whole new America!"
POLITICS_SEYMOUR_STEDMAN_DESC:0 "It was incomprehensible to many that a simple janitor would go on to become one of the Socialist Party of America's most prominent activists and legal advisers. Initially balancing his job as a janitor at the Northwestern University School of Law with taking evening classes, Stedman managed to pass the bar to became a lawyer in 1891. Although he was at first a democrat, the young Stedman became inducted into socialism when he helped defend Eugene V Debs during American Railway Union's great strike. His lifelong friendship to Debs saw him chosen as the SPA's vice presidential candidate on 1920, and after Debs' death he became a close advisor to Jack Reed. Having now outlived yet another close comrade, the old and somber Stedman has run a successful race to become the new president, intent on honoring his old friend's utopian dreams."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_RODRIGUEZ_DESC:0 "The son of a Spanish immigrant to Illinois, William Rodriguez made his living painting houses, until he could eventually afford to pursue a legal degree. Inspired by his brother in law, a radical journalist named J. Louis Engdahl to join the American Socialist party and move to Chicago. The young Rodriguez managed to win a race for the Chicago city council as a dark horse candidate, becoming the first socialist and first Hispanic to sit on the council. He soon managed to use his newfound position to attack the city's transit companies and to seek legal reforms. Although eventually ousted by a democratic and republican unity candidate, Rodriguez did not give up on politics. He continued to practice law and ran a successfully campaign in 1933 to become a judge. Building on a lifetime of legal and political experience, his next triumph came when he ran his most recent successful presidential campaign."
POLITICS_MORRIS_HILQUIT_DESC:0 "One of the oldest political figures in the Combined Syndicates, Hillquit was born in 1869, to a Jewish family living in Latvia. After his father lost his business, the young Morris and his dad crossed the Atlantic in search of a better life. Soon settled in the slums of New York, Hillquit would go on to found the Socialist Party of America alongside Victor Berger and Eugene V Debs. He ran for the senate in 1908 from New York City, garnering 21% of the votes. Despite this failure, he would later unsuccessfully run for mayor of NYC and afterwards help organize fellow socialist Meyer London's successful bid for congress. Despite suffering from numerous bouts of tuberculosis and frequent conflicts with the growing syndicalist wing of the SPA, Hillquit endured long enough to witness the revolution finally sweep through America. Although old and sickly, his seniority and eventful life has netted him a surprising victory in the latest presidential election. His age helped to invalidate dissenters who wanted a natural born citizen as President. Although some remain uncertain if he can finish his current term, President Hillquit has sworn he will serve the interests of all of America's proletariat, no matter his age or health."
POLITICS_EUGENE_DENNIS_DESC:0 "Born under the name Francis Xavier Waldron, and spending his early life as a laborer and IWW member in California, the young Waldron was driven into exile after the Californian Criminal Syndicalist Act nearly saw him imprisoned for revolutionary political activism. Fleeing to the Commune of France and taking up work as minor union politician, he became an important link between the Socialist Party of America and the Third Internationale. In 1935 he returned across the Atlantic, now hiding under the pseudonym "Eugene Dennis", to help organize Jack Reed's campaign in the coming presidential election. His services to Reed were soon rewarded with a series of influential positions within the Combined Syndicates, which served as the stepping stones for his own eventually presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ELMER_ALLISON_DESC:0 "A self-taught radical from Missouri, Elmer Allison was a founding member of both the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. He was a leading figure in the SPA's radical Washington affiliate, spending much of his life either working in the local cedar mills or atop a soapbox in Seattle's streets. A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met Jack Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City. There he was a major figure in running Reed's numerous political campaigns and leading the SPA's entry into mainstream politics. Following the revolution, his close comradeship to Reed and his zealous socialist beliefs has made him an obvious candidate for the presidency. A candidacy he has gladly pursued!"
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_NORD_DESC:0 "Elizabeth Nord grew up as the daughter of a family of poor English coal miners, having to spend her early teenage years toiling in a silk factory. Her family departed England a few years shy of the British Revolution, settling across the Atlantic in Rhode Island. In the United States Nord spent another decade as a factory worker during which she used her political finesse and determination to rise through the ranks of her local union, being elected Chairwoman. She became one of the key leaders of the Great Textile Strike of 1934, organizing the walkout of tens of thousands of workers across the country. On the outbreak of the Second civil war, she was a political representative of her union in Washington D.C, but quickly made her way across the frontlines to the Combined Syndicates of America. Repeating the same grueling political manoeuvring that put her in charge of the Great Textile Strike, Elizabeth Nord has now risen to lead something far greater than a union or a strike, she has become the new President!"
POLITICS_DAVID_DUBINSKY_DESC:0 "Dubinsky came from the former Russian Empire to America, a Polish Jew who had spent his early life organizing bunds, leading strikes and campaigning for the Bolsheviks. These actions netted him a prison sentence in Siberia, but the young Dubinsky managed to miraculously escape back to western Russia and catch a ship to carry him across the Atlantic. Spending much time working in the factories of New York City, Dubinsky became increasingly alienated from the union bureaucracy around him, starting a long-time personal feud between him and the IWW. He initially saw unions as inherently apolitical platforms that should seek further co-operation with the right wing to uplift all workers despite political beliefs, and that compromises with the federal government and business sector were practically mandatory for a union's success. Dubinsky would change his opinion after witnessing first the Great Depression, then the steady rise of Huey Long and finally the outbreak of the American civil war. Although he never made amends with the "union bureaucrats", Dubinsky ceased to compromise with the right wing and capitalism, taking on more politically extreme views. When the civil war finally ended he had been singing the praises of the new America, and already planted the seeds for a political career. Despite his controversial past, it appears David Dubinsky has now been able to reap what he has sown, rising to the position of President in spite of protests from old nativists who resist the proclamation giving him natural born rights."
POLITICS_JOHN_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The son of Welsh immigrants whom had settled in Iowa, John Lewis grew up in a company town dominated by the coal industry. At the age of 17 he went to work as a minister, becoming more and more embroiled in his hometown’s local politics and the nationwide labor movement. In 1907 he made a failed attempt to run for mayor, and later became a full-time union advocate who travelled across the steel belt. Although he initially bickered with William Z Foster over the merits of syndicalist trade unions compared to his preferred moderate and apolitical unions, the devastation of the Great Depression saw him slowly embrace more radical beliefs. Despite having once been a liberal and a republican, Lewis could not find it in his heart to endorse President Hoover's second term. Increasingly disillusioned with competitive capitalism, Lewis struck up negotiations with the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. When the American Revolution came, he had made up his mind for which side to stand on. Although his reactionary past continued to haunt him, Lewis eventually succeeded in finding a synthesis between radical unionism and his own moderate ideology, being elected as President in the latest election."
POLITICS_LUDWIG_KATTERFELD_DESC:0 "Born in Strasbourg under the German Empire and sent away to live with family in America at just 10 years of age, where he later ran away from home, Ludwig Katterfeld had a harsh and formative upbringing. After escaping his extended family, he took up work as a farmhand in Kansas, spending his teenage years balancing hard labour with honing his impressive oratory skills and sharp intellect. The next two decades were a turbulent time for Katterfeld, seeing him become a professed socialist and move from state to state to launch new political ambitions. After graduating college in 1910 he moved to Chicago and lead his own short-lived socialist party, the "Lyceum Bureau". He became involved with the Socialist Party of Washington and in 1916 launched a failed gubernatorial bid with them. In 1922 he was the provisional secretary of the Socialist Party of America, and later a representative in their behalf to the Third Internationale. It was in Paris he met Jack Reed, whom he accompanied back to America the very next year. In 1923 both men played a key role in the brief, radical Seattle Commune. The events of the commune compelled the bitter and austere Katterfeld to go underground, breaking with Reed's desire to go into mainstream electoral politics. From there on Katterfeld worked as an independent activist, not resurfacing until the Civil War. He did not have a chance to reconnect with Reed until the closing days of the revolution, with the latter on his deathbed. Compelled to honor his old friendship to Reed and armed with a lifetime of revolutionary experience, Katterfeld has launched into the spotlight with a narrow victory in the recent presidential race."
POLITICS_HENNING_BLOMEN_DESC:0 "A son of Massachusetts born in 1910, Henning was too young to experience the horrors of the Weltkrieg, but old enough to face the American Revolution in his prime. Initially an industrial worker in Cambridge, he was one of the few who did not leave his station the moment the first gunshots of the Second Civil War could be heard. A committed pacifist, Henning Blomen instead helped organize the chemical plant he worked at into a cooperative syndicate. His efforts were greatly appreciated by his more radical co-workers, who nominated him as a Massachusetts representative to the Combined Syndicates and helped him cross the front lines to New York City. Soon climbing his way up the political ladder, Henning Blomen has continuously made a name for himself with his unshakable optimism and iron will, running over a dozen major political races in his lifetime, the most recent of which has carried him all the way to the presidency."
POLITICS_JOHN_BERNARD_DESC:0 "Initially a French immigrant, Bernard worked nearly a decade of his life in the iron mines of Minnesota, later enlisting in the army. He served along the Mexican Border during the Mexican Revolution, a year later returning to Minnesota but soon discovering himself to be blacklisted from employment because his trade union activism. Pursuing a career in firefighting, then as a politician, Bernard managed to be elected to the House of Representatives on the ticket of the Farmer-Labor Party in 1936. While in office, he became more and more aligned with Jack Reed's popular front of socialists, and began to campaign for friendlier relations between America and the Commune of France. Distinguishing himself as a diligent proletariat and cunning politician, John Bernard has gone a step further and made a successful run for presidency."
POLITICS_OAKLEY_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "A voracious reader since an early age, Oakley Johnson took up a career within academia, serving as a teacher and later principal at numerous schools in his home state of Minnesota. This lasted until his commitment to radical politics became more publicly known, and he was arrested in the middle of a seminar over having contributed money to the defence fund of arrested IWW members. Undeterred, Johnson moved to New York and became a full time activist in the Socialist Party of America, helping to promote interracial relations and the education of the proletariat. In 1936 he accepted a position of Docent at a university in Paris, spending most of the coming Civil War abroad. In Paris he helped maintain diplomatic relations between the Commune of France and his comrades home in America. Eventually making the trip to the new America, Oakley Johnson has used his diplomatic accomplishments and academic merits to woo the electorate!"
POLITICS_BAYARD_RUSTIN_DESC:0 "Born in Pennsylvania, in the year of 1912, Rustin was raised in a family deeply affiliated with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was personally acquainted with notables such as W.E.B. DuBois and James Weldon Johnson, developing left leaning beliefs at an early age. This best showed in 1936 when he organized a student strike at Wilberforce University, which he was expelled over. Cast adrift, the young Rustin moved to New York City where he joined the Young People's Socialist League and got to meet Norman Thomas and A. Phillip Randolph. With the outbreak of the civil war, Bayard Rustin became a political organizer and campaigner for the Combined Syndicates championing better race relations, increased desegregation, and the immediate overturning of Jim Crow in the newly liberated southern states. Now, decades after the revolution he has made his daring bid for the presidency despite the fact that Rustin's youth, skin color and known homosexual relationships have for long been targets of slander and ridicule. Although one might expect any one of those three to have stopped him, he has powered through regardless and been elected the first African-American head of state in American history."
POLITICS_DARLINGTON_HOOPES_DESC:0 "Darlington Hoopes came from a notable family of Pennsylvania Quakers, during his time at boarding school he augmented his religious upbringing with an interest in radical socialism, going on to identify as a Christian Socialist. His ideological beliefs soon drew him close to fellow Christian Socialist, Norman Thomas and the rest of the Socialist Party of America. In 1930, Hoopes was elected to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, where his most celebrated accomplishment was completely outlawing child labor in his home state. Much like it did to Thomas, the outbreak of the civil war disgusted Hoopes. Although he could not deny its accomplishments in hindsight, his political cause after the war was to champion reconstruction and reconciliation between Americans. This benevolent, reformative platform earned him more and more influence in the new America, allowing him to make a bid for the presidency."
POLITICS_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "Marine, General, and Senator Smedley Butler has done the unthinkable. In the revolution's darkest moment, he has overthrown the would-be usurpers and traitors in the Centralist clique, and kept the flame of liberty alive. The old general has been an invaluable warrior for the Combined Syndicates, and his latest startling victory has endeared him to the population tenfold. Although Butler has confided to friends and political allies that he is uneasy to now be in the spotlight, he has agreed to take on the job as the temporarily acting president of the new America until the scars torn open by totalism can once again be healed."
POLITICS_PRESIDENT_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "A Marine, a General, and even a Senator, Smedly Butler has not been idle in recent years. Few expected, though, that he would ascend to the presidency, but this shocking turn of events has occurred. With the war over, Butler has committed himself to the political realm, becoming the country's leader militarily as well as politically. He considers himself a part of the Nationalist faction, having been inspired by Bellamy's ideas in his earlier years, and will now work to advance their platform on the national stage. Many have likened him to George Washington, and it is certainly true that the two war heroes have led the country through the hardships of their times with immense support behind them. With this support and Butler's own determination, there is no doubt he will bring his vision to life."
POLITICS_JAMES_BURNHAM_DESC:0 "A fellow-travelor of the far-left ever since he's been politically active, James Burnham began as a starry-eyed supporter of the Russian Revolution before seeing it quashed. His hope in socialism was revitalized with the British and French Revolutions only to witness the Empires of old not only persist but reform themselves internally. Influenced by French Sorelianism and his personal readings of Machiavelli he has come to view politics as largely a power struggle between competing elites with revolutions only temporarily succeeding in nations that failed to modernize their elite into a "Managerialist" class of technocratic minds as opposed to the aristocrats and capitalists of old. Viewing imperialist expansion as an inevitable consequence of their growing bureaucracies and promotion of national myths Burnham is dismayed by what he views as the infighting and factionalism promoted by traditional syndicalism and views socialism's only hope as being the promotion of a highly technocratic-oriented leadership alongside an American Nationalism that shall glue the nation together where socialism can not. His American Worker's Party (AWP) is currently a combination of his followers who de facto left the SPA's Federalist faction with him, Lovestoneites, national-syndicalists and Howard Scott's Technocratic Movement. While the latter has questionable loyalties to socialism he has promised to place them in charge of the economy in return for allowing him to run the political sphere in the power-oriented method he views as necessary."

## Commune of France ##
POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC:0 "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchiste to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Originally empowered to chairman in a compromise between the Travailleurs and Anarchistes, factionalism has grown considerably during his time in office, and the apparatus of the state has weakened. If any faction manages to gain a clear majority in the Comité de Salut Public and the Bourse Générale du Travail, Faure is likely to be ousted."
POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC:0 "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC:0 "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "General Maurice Gamelin has overthrown the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While his coup is an obvious affront to the already dubious Communard democratic process, many now regard Gamelin as the saviour of the Commune, and even syndicalism itself."
POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC:0 "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordiality with syndicalists and anarchists."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Georges Valois, an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian anarchist, fled his homeland for France following German intervention in the Russian Civil War. Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his French electoral victory. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future, but his support for decentralisation could forever transform the Commune."
POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC:0 "Jacques Doriot, veteran of the Weltkrieg, returned from captivity in Germany to find a France forever changed. His personal transformation from moderate socialist, to Leninist, and now national-syndicalist, has instilled in him an engrained proclivity for compromise."
POLITICS_VINCENT_AURIOL_DESC:0 "Vincent Auriol, long accused by hardline syndicalists of harbouring sympathies for the bourgeoisie, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. He advocates the gradual transition to a more democratic system of government in the Commune."
POLITICS_DANIEL_GUERIN_DESC:0 "Daniel Guérin has now not only usurped from the charismatic Nestor Makhno leadership of the Anarchiste faction of the French Commune, but also won the chairmanship itself. Guérin is an academic, and a moderate in comparison to Makhno, who has proven to be a capable lawmaker."
POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC:0 "Marcel Déat has upended the Communard political system. A Leninist who has frequently made public his contempt for syndicalism, Déat stands in opposition to much of France's political establishment. His many enemies both within and outside France could lead to his, and perhaps also the Commune's, downfall."

POLITICS_MANUEL_BISBE_DESC:0 "Among the founders of the Cuban Authentic Party, Manuel Bisbé Alberni and other more moderate members left the organisation shortly before the bloodbath of 1935, and like many other ex-Authentics, joined with the Unionistas. Rumors circulated during the Havana Strike that Bisbé was directly involved with some moderate dissident groups, and while such speculation was never confirmed, Bisbé's appointment to boss of the Unionista Party following Rafael Trejo's retirement was almost certainly motivated his favorability among the dissatisfied."
POLITICS_MARIO_GARCIA_MENOCAL_DESC:0 "President from 1913 to 1921, many Cubans look back on Menocal's time in office with great fondness. Before the scandals of Zayas and the tyranny of Machado, the man remains one of Cuba's most respected heads of state. Following the revolution of 1928 and worried with the nation's political direction, Menocal re-entered politics and was elected to the Cuban senate. There, he and his new National Democratic Association allied with the remenants of the old Liberal Party to oppose, at least ostensibly, the military and Unionistas alike."
POLITICS_RAMON_GRAU_MARTIN_DESC:0 "As a professor at the University of Havana's medical school, Grau with other dissidents within the faculty and student body to resist the rule of Gerardo Machado. While Grau was not directly involved in organizing the mass student protests which catalyzed the revolution of 1928, he and his supporters quickly emerged as a powerful political force in the chaotic time immediately thereafter. A staunch nationalist, he was far from satisfied with the post-revolutionary status quo and while he initially supported the Unionistas in their power struggle against the military, his fervor and ever-increasing disdain for the socialist-bloc led to his utilizing extra-legal means to achieve his goals. In cooperation with army officers disaffected with the leadership of General Diaz, Grau's politically convenient thugs grew into a radical bonafide paramilitary and Grau turned more and more from his democrat ideals, his anger growing with his authoritarianism.\nAmidst the chaos following the election of 1935, Grau, now operating from the countryside where government rule had all but collapsed, hardened into the man he is today; both an idealist and a tyrant, steadfast yet so quick to compromise his beliefs, Ramón Grau San Martín is a walking contradiction."
POLITICS_LAZARO_PENA_DESC:0 "The young Lazaro Peña succeeded Sandalio Junco as boss of the CNOC totally inexperienced. Peña's meteoric rise in the short time since caught many among even Cuba's left off guard. An advocate of complete collectivisation and industrial development, Peña wears the moribund label of 'communist' with pride. Despite this, the CNOC and its leadership both past and present, have both embraced many aspects of European syndicalism and paradoxically call for cultivation of a stronger Cuban national identity in an internationalist context."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_GUITERAS_DESC:0 "As leader of the Cuban Socialist Party following the Cuban revolution of 1928, Guiteras was a thorn in the side of Cuba's military kingmakers and instrumental in the survival of the party and socialism in general in Cuba following the events of 1935. Now, as chairman of the broad 'Socialist Movement', successor to the old party, and President of Cuba, Guiteras will undoubtedly be equally involved in shaping the future of the nation. While Guiteras is a relatively orthodox syndicalist, he possesses his own unique ideological quirks which could be crucial to the nation's ultimate fortune."
POLITICS_JUAN_HERNANDEZ_DESC:0 "Often compared to Nicaragua's Sandino, Juan Blas Hernández waged a years-long guerilla war in Cuba's southern hills. He is first and foremost a man of the people, and more than willing to fight and bleed for the sake of the nation's least fortunate. Now in power, President Hernández seeks not only to live up to his grandiose rhetoric, but the larger-than-life reputation he has garnered among many in the Cuban peasantry."
POLITICS_RAFAEL_TREJO_DESC:0 "As a young law student at the University of Havana, Rafael Trejo González grew increasingly disillusioned with the authoritarian regime of Gerardo Machado Morales. He joined the newly founded anti-Machado 'University Student Directory', established along the lines of the defunct 'University Student Federation', as well as the equally disaffected 'Law Students Association'. By late 1927 he had become influential in the former and the President of the latter. Trejo's impassioned yet collected denunciations of Machado and his influence within the university as well as his close association with Socialist disciples of exiled former student leader, Julio Mella McPartland, led to his forced dismissal following pressure from Machado's government. In response, Trejo led demonstrations in Havana and with the support of elements of the Cuban Army, overthrew Machado. Thereafter, Trejo, with the support of the military under the presumption that he would be easily controlled on account of his age, was appointed President instead of his older colleagues within the new caretaker government. Despite becoming President of Cuba just after his 18th Birthday and amidst rising tensions between his more extreme coalition partners, Trejo effectively guided the nation through the tumultuous years that followed his revolution."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_GOMEZ_DESC:0 "The son of Cuba's second president, José Gómez, Miguel Gómez was first elected to national public office during the Machado era. While he begrudgingly followed the Liberal Party line and lent Machado his support, he was among the most vocal supporters within the legislature of the student demonstrations that toppled the Machado regime. Following the success of the student revolution and the collapse of the Liberal Party, Gómez founded the Republican Party along with other moderate members within the defunct Liberal Party's right-wing. Opposed to undue regulation, Gómez envisions a Cuba enriched by a flourishing financial sector and booming trade with the wider world."
POLITICS_CARLOS_MENDIETA_DESC:0 "Senate President Mendieta succeeded Clemente Vazquez as President of Cuba following the latter's assassination, and Vazquez's shoes have proven hard to fill. Regardless, Mendieta, though calls for reform abound, even from within his own party, attempts to maintain the character of the executive established under his authoritarian predecessor."
POLITICS_JOSE_BARNET_DESC:0 "Following a long and illustrious career as a diplomat, Jose Agrapino Barnet was appointed as President by an outgoing Carlos Mendieta. While many assumed his Presidency would be a fleeting 'lame duck', Barnet approaches his position with a degree of professionalism rarely seen in Cuba's cutthroat political atmosphere."
POLITICS_MARTIN_TAMAYO_DESC:0 "As a junior officer stationed near the Cuban Presidential Palace, Martin Diaz first came to prominence at the head of a contingent of soldiers who joined with the student revolution of 1928. Finding himself at the forefront of a rapidly coalescing faction within the military and granted the rank of General, the merely thirty year old Diaz soon became the most powerful individual in Cuba, even more influential in the nation's politics than the President himself. Now, years later as President in his own right, Diaz stands nearly unopposed as the luminous sun around which Cuban politics orbit."
POLITICS_CLEMENTE_VAZQUEZ_DESC:0 "Clemente Vazquez was among president Machado's closest confidants and the President of the Senate for most of Machado's tenure, and despite many close calls, survived multiple attempts of his life following Machado's downfall. Unlike so many of old Liberal party, Vazquez held fast to the authoritarian model for the presidency established by Machado. Thanks to American brokerage of several informal deals with General Diaz, Vazquez returned to Cuban politics after only a short stint laying-low in the American embassy, and quickly found his feet. As President, Vazquez continues to emulate his older mentor, and many Cubans find his rule to be nearly indistinguishable from that of Machado."
POLITICS_JULIO_MELLA_DESC:0 "Grandson of Dominican hero, Matías Mella, Julio Mella had his first run in with the law as a first year university student during the tenure of president Zayas. As President of the ideologically socialist University Students Federation, Mella attempted to resist the authoritarian regime of Gerado Machado. For this, he was exiled to Mexico for the next eleven years. Upon his return, Mella quickly re-established his position within the Cuban left and brought with him a new ideology known as 'transformationism' influenced by Mexican agrarian socialist strains of thought. As President, Mella seeks to turn Cuba into a model for 'transformationism' for the world, no matter the cost or who may attempt to stand in his way."
POLITICS_CARLOS_CESPEDES_DESC:0 "Carlos de Céspedes, son of the Cuban independence hero of the same name, spent decades in politics and the Cuban diplomatic service. While ostensibly loyal to Machado during that pivotal tyrant's tenure, Céspedes secretly worked to undermine his regime, coordinating closely with other disaffected Liberal party members. Soon after the student revolution, Céspedes returned to elected office with a stint in the Senate, wherein he founded the New Liberal Party to unite like-minded former Liberals who with the dissolution of the Liberal Party lacked any formal association. As president, Céspedes looks to return Cuba to the early days of the Zayas regime, without the alleged corruption of course, and with a consciousness for often overlooked social and political realities."
POLITICS_RAUL_ROA_DESC:0 "Grandson of a decorated Mambí, Raúl Roa first developed his revolutionary socialist ideals as a student activist against the regime of Gerado Machado. Upon his release from prison, he worked closely with extralegal socialist opposition groups and the ideologically mixed 'University Student Directory' at the University of Havana. While not a direct participant of the protests which precipitated Machado's ousting, he found a platform writing for various left-wing publications, gain a good degree of celebrity among Cuban socialists. While Roa was only appointed to the office of the Presidency as part of a compromise between Cuba's feuding socialist factions, he possesses a knack for leadership and public speaking beyond his years."
POLITICS_ALBERTO_BAYO_DESC:0 "Expelled from the Cuban Air corps for pistol-dueling another airman, Alberto Bayo joined the Spanish Legion and fought in that nation's colonial war in northern Morocco. Returning to Cuba in 1932 following the dissolution of the short-lived Spanish Republic, Bayo joined with the rebel Juan Blas, training guerillas to fly whatever small aircraft they managed to capture.

Despite working with other socialist groups out of necessity, Junco disagreed deeply with the ideology and personal character of other socialist leader such as Antonio Guiteras and Juan Blas. Eventually forced to step down from his position as chairman of the CNOC by disaffected younger members, Junco retained a large of degree of influence within the organisation and the 'Comunista' faction of the Cuban Socialist Movement. As President, Junco seeks total collectisation of land and the nation's rapid forced indutrial development."

Years later, she met and, out of character with her history of moving from one affair to the next, eventually married Cuban exile, Julio Mella. Upon the Cuban socialist revolution, Modotti returned with her new husband to the island, helping to re-establish his political career from the moment her feet first touched Cuban soil. After climbing through the ranks of her husband's government, Modotti succeeded him upon his death, becoming Cuba's first female head of state. She remains committed to her husband's transformationist ideology and authoritarian style of governance."

CHRISTIAN_X_DESC:0 "Christian von Glücksburg rose to the Danish throne in 1912 after his father, king Frederick VIII, passed away in Hamburg. The king has thus guided Denmark through the Weltkrieg, in which the nation remained neutral and into the interwar, presiding the political shift that composed the rise of the social democrats of Thorvald Stauning in 1924. It is said that the king is sceptical about the prime minister and his party, but that he accepts their position in government in the knowledge that he can use his reserve power should excesses occur.\n\nMany have considered that the fact that this has still not happened after 12 years means that the king eventually accepted the democratic parliamentarism that has been in place since the ascension of the Deuntzer cabinet in 1901."

POLITICS_HEINRICH_GOLDBERG_DESC:0 "Heinrich Goldberg first came to prominence as the leader of a small anarchist commune on the outskirts of Berlin during the Weltkrieg and subsequent flight from the country to the then newly established Commune of France. While in France, his views became increasingly coloured by French orthodox syndicalism, and upon his departure for the Dominican Republic in 1928, he had become a fervent supporter of Emile Pouget\nIn the Dominican Republic, his early efforts to promote syndicalism were mostly ineffective, but he managed to cultivate a small and devoted following, becoming the face of the Syndicalist movement in his adopted country."
POLITICS_PERDRO_HENRIQUEZ_URENA_DESC:0 "While slandered by political opponents for his marriage to the sister of Mexican Syndicalist, Vicente Lombardo Toledano, Pedro Henríquez Ureña, son of former president Francisco Henríquez Carvajal, returned to the Dominican Republic after years abroad to a great degree of fanfare. Despite comparisons to his radical brother-in-law, however, Henríquez is by no means a syndicalist; the principled writer, is however, more than willing to work any across the political spectrum who subscribe to the view that the Dominican Republic, and indeed all of Latin America, should be entirely free of imperialist influence, and able to fully choose their own destiny."

The younger Jimenes entered politics soon after returning to the Dominican Republic in 1929 from Germany, and soon established a small but devoted following."
POLITICS_ESTRELLA_URENA_DESC:0 "Rafael Estrella Ureña, while ideologically a social and economic reformist, gained a great deal of infamy even before the American occupation for his seemingly endless ambition and lust for political power. Since the end of the occupation, Estrella's name has only become further tainted by his willingness to work closely with both the military and members of the nation's economic elite."
POLITICS_MARTINEZ_REYNA_DESC:0 "Virgilio Martínez Reyna was essential to the 1924 election of Horacio Vásquez Lajara as the Dominican Republic's first president since the American Occupation. In his own presidential tenure, he has been equally central to the nation's incessant political turmoil. While popular and far less corrupt than his predecessors, Martínez's failure to quell discontent amongst the nation's economic elite and even begin to address the political power of the Army precipitated the nation's political direction thereafter.\nIdeologically, Martínez draws heavily on a uniquely populous Catholic corporatism, and while indeed not entirely authoritarian, is more than willing to undermine the foundations of Dominican democracy if need be."

But one, unsinkable truth for the King-Emperor is that the new Dominion is no Raj- it is but just a shaving of the Jewel of the Crown. No longer does the Crown maintain an iron grip on the subcontinent, but a loose alliance with the north- a truth that does not help the demeanour of the King-Emperor in the slightest, and a truth that sits uncomfortably with the Delhi Government, of whom many members wish to break all ties with the King-Emperor and declare home rule. For now, the King-Emperor still rules, but his power is diminished and his roar is now a soft bark."

The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_CHAMBER_OF_PRINCES_DESC:0 "The Chamber of Princes was originally established by King-Emperor George V during the Weltkrieg to appease the increasingly unruly Indian nobility. The instability and political violence that followed the British revolution necessitated that, to maintain authority, the unelected Chamber was delegated substantial governmental authority, and eventually reorganized into the proper upper-house of the now bi-cameral Indian legislature. Upon the death of the viceroy of India, the Chamber is responsible for appointing a successor."
POLITICS_GANGA_SINGH_DESC:0 "Ganga Singh, prince of Bikaner, proved a capable military leader during the Weltkrieg, eventually becoming the only Indian member of the British Imperial War Cabinet. Not just a military man however, Singh proved to be an astute politician, gaining a substantial following by advocating sweeping yet gradual reform of India's convoluted political system. In his push for reform however, Singh maintained cordiality with the British administration, and gained the admiration of sympathetic aristocrats. Due to his popularity, Singh's support was crucial for then Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, in transforming India from an appendage of the British Empire into an independent Dominion."

He seeks to promote the social standing of the Dalits without destroying India's social and political order."
POLITICS_RATANJI_DADABHOY_TATA_DESC:0 "Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, son of perhaps India's most famous industrialist, after whom Jehangir is named, fled his native Paris during the Weltkrieg, shortly before Germany captured the city. Upon arrival in Delhi, Jehangir's father fell increasingly ill, and Jehangir assumed control of the Tata business empire. Jehangir personally financed counter-insurgency operations in the wake of the break-up of the Raj, and in the process, became increasingly involved in Dominion politics, eventually being appointed as chief of the Indian national bank."
POLITICS_ATUL_CHANDRA_CHATTERJEE_DESC:0 "Atul Chandra Chatterjee, diplomat and moderate labor activist, served diligently in the British Raj's 'Indian Civil Service'; he was the British High Commissioner to India when the British Revolution struck, and upended India's political system. His efforts were pivotal to the establishment of the Dominion's foreign service, even personally managing most of his nation's diplomats when issues arose. Following Viceroy Ganga Singh's appointment, Chatterjee became even more prominent in India politics, even striking up a friendship with Singh. Chatterjee has been a vocal advocate of state protection of the rights of India's industrial laborers."
POLITICS_SRINIVASA_SASTRI_DESC:0 "Srinivasa Sastri, who founded the Indian Liberal Party after leaving the Indian National Congress, is renowned for negotiating a degree of autonomy for India shortly before the British Revolution. Sastri, though once nearly incarcerated for his association with the Indian Home Rule League, and not opposed to India's recent declaration of a republic, is quite an anglophile; he believes that the institutions established by the British should be maintained."
POLITICS_MINOCHER_MASANI_DESC:0 "Minocher Rustom Masani, a vocal proponent of classical liberalism, split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's drift towards socialism. Masani is a charismatic and good-natured man, who, despite policy disagreements, maintains personal friendships with many political rivals, even those of the Indian National Congress. Minocher similarly enjoys even the most mundane of political decision, often speaking for hours on end on the floor of parliament on the minutia of financial decisions and administrative budgets. Minocher's attention to detail and gregarious nature has won him a large political following."
POLITICS_NARASIMHA_KELKAR_DESC:0 "Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's increasingly socialist stance. Shortly before the disintegration of the British Raj, Kelkar, and other more liberal Congress defectors founded the Swaraj (meaning independence or self-governance) Party to promote parliamentarian democracy in India. Kelkar is not only a man of politics, however; he is an accomplished playwright, and his works have been responsible for igniting increased national identity and political consciousness among the people of India."

Kher rose in political prominence by advocating for the protection of the rights of India's lower castes, and it is from these lower caste's that he draws the greatest support. Kher is known for his compassion for the less fortunate outside politics as well; he is known to personally involve himself in charitable endeavours, and is as likely to be found attending to his political duties, as assisting in the construction of a new orphanage or staffing a soup kitchen."
POLITICS_KANAIYALAL_MUNSHI_DESC:0 "Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi is an acclaimed author in his native Gujarat; his works cover a broad range of topics, including: law, Gujrati culture, and political theory. Though once a member of the Indian National Congress, Munshi bears a disdain for socialism, and abandoned the Congress due to its leftward drift. Munshi believes that to assure liberty for the people of India and safeguard against the encroachment of insidious socialist influence, property rights must be protected, while the estates of India's landed aristocracy must be broken up."
POLITICS_KRISHNA_MENON_DESC:0 "Krishna Menon, often accused of harbouring sympathies for socialism and the Indian National Congress, has nonetheless, become one of India's most prominent political figures. Menon is a masterful manipulator, playing the game of Indian politics much like a grandmaster would play a round of chess. With the death of his political ally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Menon was forced to step out from the shadows, and become the face of the moderate left in India. Menon is as distrustful of the West as of political rivals, fearing any continued association with the remnants of the British Empire could lead India to ruin."
POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_ALI_JINNAH_DESC:0 "Muhammad Ali Jinnah, first entered into politics to promote the interests of India's Muslim minority. Jinnah organised the Lucknow Pact between feuding Muslim and Hindu independence leaders in 1916, and founded the All-India Homerule League during the Weltkrieg to advocate Indian self-determination.

Khan began his political career as an ally of leftist Muhammad Jinnah, but drifted further from Jinnah with time. He joined the conservative Unionist Party, which had split from the Jinnah's Home Rule Party over dissatisfaction with Jinnah's leadership, and disagreement with the Party's endorsement of land redistribution; this split between Jinnah and Khan has created a political rift amongst Indian Muslims."
POLITICS_CHHOTU_RAM_DESC:0 "Chhotu Ram, after helping to found the Unionist Party, withdrew from politics to focus on social work. Ram's work led to a marked increase in the standard of living of some of the most destitute people of Punjab, and the name 'Chhotu Ram' was soon on the lips of a great many Indians. Upon his return to politics, Ram set out to reform the Unionist Party, which had evolved from an alliance of Punjabi Jats and Muslims into an organisation for the protection of the rural nobility of northern India."

He then returned to Quito and founded his own Clinic and became a professor in the Ecuadorian Central University. He gained a well-respected reputation as a medical professional and public figure, even managing to become Mayor for the town of Quito in 1924, and being chosen later as a deputy for his hometown. His meteoric rise to popularity was halted by the Conservatives taking over the country, frustrating any attempts by Ayora to become a candidate for President.

He'd return to Ecuador and join the Socialist Party of Ecuador, but would eventually leave after fighting with the leaders of the party towards the Partido Liberal. However, his left leaning views inside the PL gained him the nickname 'The fifth Bolshevik', and has managed to form a socialist faction within the PL. Now that he has managed to gain power, He shall enact social reforms to help the struggling working class.

In his time as President, he managed to approve an economic plan by the Ecuadorian banker Victor Emilio Strada, which has slowly but steadily improved the economic situation of Ecuador. However, he has broken his promises regarding guaranteeing civil liberties and respecting popular will, and the economic prosperity of Ecuador might be the only thing keeping him in power, with popular unrest strengthening his Liberal rivals."

Influenced by his French comrades, Ricardo has moved his party more towards Syndicalism than when it was first founded, even managing to acquire the nickname 'The Apostle of the Ecuadorian Syndicalism'.

In 1927, inspired by Juan Albamocho, she'd join the Movimiento Maximista Ecuatoriano, and begin organizing the natives in order to acquire better rights. Dolores managed to stage a successful insurrection in 1931, but would be crushed quickly by Gallo's forces. In 1934 she decided to join forces with Ricardo Paredes, and have since then both tried to change Ecuadorian society.

As such, she left the PSE and joined the 'Movimiento de Liberacion Ecuatoriano', and has since then climbed steadily through the ranks with her charisma until becoming their leader.

However, mounting unrest in the army have turned Salinas into the voice of opposition against Martinez.

Having defected from Martinez' forces during the Second Western Uprising, it almost seemed like the General was a defender of democracy. Apparently, He has other plans for the Salvadorian democracy, ones that differed greatly from the PL and the PND. Seeing the Red Menace looming over Central America, Castro took advantage of the government's refusal to crack down on rebellious military elements and secretly allied with them, waiting for the Laboristas to make a wrong move to take over El Salvador. Now that he is in control of the nation, he'll purge the Syndicalists from any position of power, all while trying to provide some semblance of democracy to the populace to avoid a new uprising, even if this 'Democracy' will prove to be nothing but a ruse..."
POLITICS_ALFONSO_MOLINA_DESC:0 "Alfonso Quiñónez Molina has had a long political career by Salvadorian standards.

Public outraged ensued after his election, with plenty of media outlets considering his rule as a pseudo-monarchy which came to be known as the Meléndez-Quiñones Dynasty. Despite the bad press though, his rule saw the greatest coffee boom ever registered in El Salvador's history, making the nation reach record levels of economic prosperity and catapulting Molina's popularity to new heights. However, many episodes of repression during his rule had severely damaged his reputation and was forced to step down when his term was over. The hardships El Salvador has been forced to endure in his absense have made many miss the times of prosperity that he brought, and with a lack of any other strong liberal candidates, the PND decided to contact Molina once again to lead the liberal coalition, to which Molina has gladly accepted. Now that he's back in power, he has promised to do anything in his power to deliver prosperity back to the Salvadorian nation and its people."
POLITICS_ARTURO_ARUAJO_DESC:0 "Arturo Araujo Fajardo studied to become an engineer in England, where he became a strong follower of the British Labour Party's policies before the Weltkrieg.

The Laboristas won the 1931 election, and Araujo's career seemed to have practically skyrocketed overnight. However, economic hardship, social instability and opposing the interests of the army and the rural oligarchy only weakened Araujo's position further and further. His presidency came to an end when his Vice-President and Minister of War, Maximiliano Hernandez Martínez made a successful coup d'etat in December 2nd, 1931, sidelining Araujo from any politically relevant position and ending democracy in El Salvador. However, with the Second Western Rebellion being successful and Araujo having been chosen to lead his country for the transition to a full democracy once again, he has become a beloved figure in El Salvador, and his rule is bound to see progressive reforms and welfare be introduced to the nation."

However, with time, Martí grew further and further apart from Sandino, with them disagreeing more and more often on the fate of their countries should their revolutions succeed. Martí eventually gew further and further appart, and their relationship reached a breaking point in 1929 where Martí tried to punch Sandino in a drunken rampage. Despite having apologized formally with Sandino several times, he decided to return to El Salvador in 1930 and start leading the revolutionary movement by himself. His time would come in 1932 where he tried to lead the First Western Uprising, but after being delivered a crushing defeat by Martinez, he fled to Mexico to continue preparing for the revolution in El Salvador.

He never even set foot in his duchy, as it was one of the first places where Federal forces were forced to withdraw from during the chaotic Civil War in Italy. The second son of Karl I, Roberto grew up in Austria alongside the royal family, and despite having learned Italian, seldom thought about his duties as head of the house of Austria-Este for most of his life. But now, he is Duke, and few can argue that his position isnt exactly enviable, as recovering the land ravaged by Syndicalism while having to deal with a brand new political landscape, having essentially no political experience, is quite the dauting task."
POLITICS_DUKE_ELIAS_DESC:0 "Born in 1880, Elias of Bourbon-Parma has never sat on a throne, for like most monarchs of the Federation, he never was in a position to return during the trumoil of the war on the wake of the Treaty of Rome. Having lived in exile in family estates for most of his life, he was forced to leave his birthplace in France following the Revolution, but even before that the french state harried his family for their ties to Austria-Hungary during the Weltkrieg. While he technically acted as a regent for his demented brothers, Elias has been long the de-facto head of the house, and his ascension to the throne of the now restored throne is little more than a fait-accompli of dynastic politics. However, there is no shortage of criticism for what some see as brazen ambition being put ahead of his own brother's well being."

## Eritrea ##
POLITICS_WOLDE_SELLASSIE_DESC:0 "Son of Italian father and Eritrean mother, the Tigray Wolde Selassie also goes by his Italian name, Domenico Mondelli. Having been adopted by Italian officers during the first Italo-Abyssinian war, he never held the Ethopians in high regard. A soldier with great distinction, he served with great honours during the losing fight of Italy against the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg, but was forced to return to his homeland during the trumoil that followed the Civil War there. His mixed ancestry and well known competency and bravery in battle make him the ideal leader for the fledgling Eritrean state, a role the military-minded man may not be fully prepared to in state terms. But he is prepared to fight against the Ethiopians once again, and to defend his home, for he already lost his former one."

Upon climbing the throne the new Emperor, eager to wield the power he had finally obtained, started a series of sweeping political reforms to bring Abyssinia 'into the west'. In 1923 he toured Europe, inspecting schools, hospitals, factories, and churches, and the contact with the European way of life had greatly impressed him, for he intended to modernise Abyssinia to the European standard. These reforms, however, were fiercely opposed by the powerful conservative elements of the nation and have been delayed by the economic problems affecting the Empire, especially the debt he inherited from Zewditu's reign, and the pervasive and invasive German economic influence"

POLITICS_ADALBERT_I_DESC:0 "Adelbert von Hohenzollern's tenure as king of the Flems and Walloons has been quite peculiar. Inaugurated not by coronation, but by swearing an oath on the constitution, Adelbert, who also converted to Catholicism to align himself with his nation's populace, has long sought the respect, if not admiration, of his people. Years of oppression under the German regime and a tendency for Adelbert to cling on to a more absolutist type of monarchy than the Belgian system have led to great anti-German sentiment among the populace, making Adelbert despised and hated amongst the common folk."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_DESC:0 "Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the king who trounced the invading Germans at the Yzer, has returned to Belgium from exile in Canada. When his motorcade entered Brussels for the first time since the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, church bells across the nation rang, and many Belgians weeped with joy. German collaborators and syndicalists, however, lament the restored king, and plot to undermine the new Belgian government. Albert must now mend the deep wounds which have marred Belgium, and create a renewed sense of hope among its people."
POLITICS_JORIS_SEVEREN_DESC:0 "Joris Van Severen, Flemish leader who begrudgingly cooperated with the occupying Germans, has assumed control of the country. His Verdinaso has a radical vision for the direction of Belgium, including territorial expansion and the promotion of Catholicism in all aspects of society. Under van Severen, a new Belgium will certainly arise; though that new nation may be incredibly different from the one that came before it."
POLITICS_PAUL_ZEELAND_DESC:0 "Paul van Zeeland and the Catholic Party led Flemish resistance to German control. With electoral victory in the now restored Belgium, van Zeeland endeavours to establish Christian Democracy in Belgium, and reconcile that which divides Belgium's people, Flems and Walloons alike. Principle among his policy goals is the betterment of working conditions for both farmers and industrial laborers."
POLITICS_BELGIAN_PARLIMENT_DESC:0 "The Belgian Parliament, successor to the Flemish Council which advised the German controlled government of Flanders-Wallonia, has assumed power in the recently restored Belgium. While the Government is restructured and elections prepared, Parliament acts not just as a legislature, but collectively as interim head of state."
POLITICS_HENRIK_MAN_DESC:0 "Henrik de Man, a moderate social democrat, has consolidated his leadership of the Belgian Workers' Party, and now achieved victory in Belgium's latest national elections. De Man advocates limited economic nationalisation and the empowerment of union leaders to a governmental advisory role. Belgium, De Man believes, must actively serve its people and promote fair competition; his reforms, though controversial, may yet decrease economic hardship and political radicalisation in Belgium."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_JACQUEMOTTE_DESC:0 "Joseph Jacquemotte, creator and editor of the leftist pre-Weltkrieg newspaper 'L'Exploité', and his Syndicalist faction of the Belgian Workers' Party have achieved victory both within the party, and now, Belgium itself. Jacquemotte advocates rural industrialisation and the collectivisation of industry and agriculture alike. A Belgium led by Jacquemotte is certain to see drastic societal and economic upheaval."
POLITICS_PAUL_HENRI_SPAAK_DESC:0 "Paul Henri Spaak, once a prominent lawyer, believes that, above all else, to truly serve the people, government bureaucracy must be efficient. Spaak is now in control of the Belgian Workers' Party, and the party's subsequent victory in the most recent Belgian national elections has elevated him to head of state. Spaak has already begun to greatly decrease the bloated Belgian civil service and introduced new incentives to prospective entrepreneurs; as a result, optimism seems to be steadily increasing in Belgium."
POLITICS_PAUL_EMILE_JANSON_DESC:0 "Paul-Émile Janson and his Liberal Party has achieved victory in Belgium's latest national elections. Janson is an advocate of laissez faire economics and free trade; all aspects of society, to Janson, have been far too regulated by past administrations. Belgium, under Janson, is quickly becoming one of the most economically free nations in Europe and the world."

POLITICS_ANTONIO_SOTO_FOP_DESC:0 "Antonio Soto Canalejo was born in 1897 in the city of Ferrol, La Coruña province, Spain. His father died when he was very young, and he was forced to move to Argentina with his brother when he was just thirteen years old. Already as a teenager, he was exposed to the anarchist ideals by the people he met while he travelled with the 'Serrano-Mendoza' traveling theater company. He participated in a strike of trade employees in Trelew, Chubut province, that turned into an open rebellion, with him fighting alongside the strikers. Although the revolt was crushed, he gained valuable experience for his future uprising.\n\nWhen the second Patagonic strike came about, after wealthy landlords decided to ignore the requests that had been agreed between the strikers and the government, he decided to join up with the strikers and organize their insurrection. The strike led up to a stand-off at the 'La Anita' farm, where Soto rallied the disillusioned workers with a fiery speech and managed to hold back an army detachment lead by Lieutenant Colonel Varela. His forces began growing with simple workers who wanted better working conditions and eager idealists alike, and would later join up Alfredo Fonte's forces in 1923 in the events that lead to the creation of the FOP. 'El Gallego' has become a legendary figure for the workers in the FOP and anarchists worldwide, and he'll strive to bring the anarchist ideals of justice and equality into Argentinean society, in a peaceful way if possible and in a violent way if necessary."
POLITICS_MANUEL_BALDOMERO_UGARTE_DESC:0 "Manuel Baldomero Ugarte was born in 1875 in the Argentinean Capital, Buenos Aires City. Born to a wealthy family, he attended the 'Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires', where he became an avid reader and enthusiast writer. In 1897, he travelled to Paris in order to continue his studies. He assisted Philosophy and Sociology courses and began following Jean Jaurés after the US's intervention of Cuba in 1894, where he began manifesting his hatred towards imperialism. He joined up a group of young writers in Argentina and they all affiliated the Partido Socialista. However, the Partido Socialista's conservative leadership by Juan B. Justo quickly antagonized the young group, which formed its own more combative faction within the PS.\n\nWhen the FOP broke off, Ugarte couldn't stand Justo's inaction, and decided to leave towards the newly-born nation. While Ugarte has shown devotion to the revolutionary ideals, he also has many differences with his fellow revolutionaries. He staunchly defends freedom of religion and the concept of nations, reaffirming his love for the Argentinean nation and culture. However, he also believes in joining forces with other socialists in order to stop imperialism into South America, and as such, he'll strive to unite America under his banner."
POLITICS_FANNY_JABCOVSKY_DESC:0 "Fanny Jabcovsky was born in 1911 in San Francisco, Cordoba, Argentina. She began working in 1925 in a textile workshop when she was just fourteen years old, but would later drop off her job to become a music teacher. She then met journalist Eduardo Edelman, with whom she'd meet writers Leónidas Barletta and Álvaro Yunque, who convinced her to become a communist in 1934. Finding her new ideals now clashing with her life, she decided to go to the FOP with her husband. Her trip was long and hard, and they barely managed to cross the Rio Negro as the Argentinean Border Guard closed in on them. An FOP's border guard patrol that was passing by intervened, and Fanny survived the subsequent skirmish.\n\nSince then, she has joined up the border guard of the FOP in order to help other revolutionaries escape to the FOP and help protect it from reactionary aggression. She became an active member of the force, participating in plenty of border skirmishes between 1934 and 1936, which have granted her a lot of experience and popularity amongst the FOP's populace. Now that she leads the FOP, she'll use her military experience to fight off imperialism, and try to unite South America under the banner of internationalism."
POLITICS_KING_OF_MAPUCHES_DESC:0 "Jacques Antoine Bernard, better known by his regal name 'Antoine III' was born in 1880 in París, France. A French nobleman, who inherited the self-proclaimed title of King of Araucania and Patagonia from his father, who rules over a population that is rather apathetic to him. While the Mapuches had agreed on a French king a few decades past, things have changed a lot since then. The people he rules are as foreign to him as he is to them, which makes his legitimacy doubtful at best."
POLITICS_VARELA_PATA_DESC:0 "Héctor Benigno Varela was responsible for suppressing the Patagonian Strikes during the 20's. During his first encounter with the strikers, he was lenient and allowed them to continue, considering the strikers were right in reclaiming better rights from their employers. However, during the second Patagonian strike, his ruthlessness shined through, as he demanded the strikers to surrender unconditionally, even executing the messengers Soto sent to reach an agreement. However, he failed to contain the uprising, and his failure gained him a demotion in the army. However, since then he has worked closely with the Liga Patriotica, gaining valuable experience in anti-insurgency tactics, and now that he's military governor of the Patagonia, he will rule with an iron fist and hunt down those who once dared to humiliate him"
POLITICS_FONTE_FOP_DESC:0 "Alfredo Fonte, better known as 'El Toscano', was the leader of a group of anarchist bandits which roamed the Patagonia, attacking isolated farms, homesteads and even villages back in 1921, at the time of the Second Patagonian Strike. He met up with Micaela Feldman de Echebéhère during those years, who taught him military strategy, and turned the brigand into a proper general. In 1923, he met up with Soto in Paso Ibañez, as the Patagonian uprising was growing out of control, where they both agreed to work together and settle their differences. Soto would lead the FOP, but Fonte would lead its armies, in one of the events that marked the creation of the FOP. However, he hasn't abandoned his old ways, and was seen pillaging villages across the border several times. Now that he's in power, his psychotic and violent attitude and totalitarian views are bound to change the face of the FOP forever."

Since the Weltkrieg, Germany has eclipsed its rivals, and its drive to acquire a place in the sun has been fulfilled. Even if dark clouds loom over the horizon, Kaiser Wilhelm has the support of his people, his military, and the aristocracy which lord over both."

During the occupation, Borno, with the approval of Marine General John Russell and the United States, managed to eliminate Haiti's crippling debts, complete unprecedented infrastructure projects, and stabilise the country's political turmoil. With the end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno was allowed to retain the presidency.\nDeeply Catholic and despite his willingness to work with the United States, Borno's authoritarian reign has also seen a good deal of social change, especially regarding the status of Kreyol. As he looks to the future, the aging President Borno is faced with threats to his rule both from within Haiti and without, and his successes and failures alike will undoubtedly shape Haiti's future political landscape for years to come."

He witnessed the tragic end of Vietnamese syndicalist movement and fled to France. In exile, he developed an interest in the ideology of French Jacobins, Vanguardism. The idea of a vanguard group of disciplined intellectuals leading the revolution captured him. After the split of the League in 1931, he founded Tan Viet party and started infiltrating the colony. Most of his colleagues find him forever diligent and energetic, a reliable and loveable person as well as an ideal organiser and administrator. On the other hand, his enemy fear his ability to run the party and state machine."
POLITICS_TA_THU_THAO_DESC:0 "This young radical almost shouldn't have been the chairman of the prestigious Indochinese Revolutionary League, but he is and he is well respected by his colleagues. Ta Thu Thau became a prominent activist in Saigon in the mid-1920s and joined the League in its darkest days. After the split in 1931 gave another heavy blow to the League, Ta Thu Thau rose to power. This sharp intellectual has intentionally modelled Ho Chi Minh's leading style since his assuming of the title of Chairman, trying to calm factional tensions and strengthen solidarity. The recovery of the League from the collapse largely credited to his efforts. Now, he is determined to achieve the unfulfilled dream of the martyrs——build syndicalism in Indochina."
POLITICS_NGUYEN_AN_NINH_DESC:0 "Nguyen An Ninh is respected by most Indochinese intellectuals as the true democratic soul of Indochina. He studied in Sorbonne and participated the French Revolution in 1919. In 1922, Nguyen An Ninh, Nguyen The Truyen and Nguyen Ai Quoc (Ho Chi Minh) met in Marseille and decided to plan the liberation of their motherland. Nguyen An Ninh returned to Indochina in 1924 and was arrested by German police for radical agitation. After witness the crackdown of Indochinese syndicalism, Nguyen An Ninh decided that Indochinese revolution must rely on the spontaneous uprising of peasants. Since then, he started the Aspiration Society, modelling on traditional secret societies. He often personally travels from village to village under the disguise of a monk or herbist, selling his self-made ointment, and secretly recruit members to sow the seeds of revolution. He thus won great popularity among peasants in the Mekong Delta. While his dream of complete transforming the personality of Indochinese people might not realise in the foreseeable future, his emphasis on cultural enlightenment, autonomy and spontaneity will deeply reshape Indochinese society."
POLITICS_NGUYEN_TAI_HOC_DESC:0 "Nguyen Tai Hoc is the founding leader of the Viet Nam Quo Dan Dang, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. He was a supporter of colonial reformism, but later disappointed at the empty promises of the colonial regime and became the leader of revolutionary nationalism. Although the Yen-Bai mutiny failed, his successful escape from German police after that tragedy adds another chapter in his heroic deeds. Influenced by Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, he envisages a democratic republic truly for people's welfare."

Sukarno's other great influence being the Algemeene Studieclub, which studied Dutch translations of the German constitution to form their basis of elected rule.

POLITICS_TAN_MALAKA_DESC:0 "Tan Malaka has always walked a tight rope between orthodox and heterodox beliefs. In religion, Tan's support of Sarekat Islam, an egalitarian Islamist organisation, contrasted against the hierarchy of religious leadership.

POLITICS_SUTAN_DESC:0 "A student of Amsterdam University during the fierce debates of the late 1920s, Sutan's observations turned him away from revolutionary socialism and towards the economic theories of cooperative socialism. Upon his return to Indonesia, he attempted to join the PNI. Issues with the self-sufficiency message expressed by Sukarno led to him exit from the party. In defiance of the ban on socialist parties imposed by the Dutch, Sutan created the PSI under his own very loose definition of socialism."
POLITICS_HASHIM_ASYARI_DESC:0 "Long before the world was shaken by war, Hasyim's was destroyed while he was unaware. During his Hajj, his wife and child in Java had dead. Upon his return he saw both the apathy of Muslim authorities and the oppression of the Dutch as intolerable. Hasyim used this anger to ascend through the NU to transform the relationship between Islamic teachers and their students from directional to mutual."
POLITICS_MUNAWAR_MUSSO_DESC:0 "Musso was one of the leaders of the revolutionaries in 1925, a revolution inspired by the British one which was swiftly crushed by the colonial authorities and eventually resulted in the destruction of the PKI, forcing Musso to flee to the People's Republic of Bengal, from where he got into touch with Totalist thinkers from Europe. Convinced by the revolutionary ideas of this new movement, Musso hosted a reading and translation of the Totalist Charter among Insulindian exiles in Calcutta, subsequently forming the Partai Totalis Insulindia (PTI) that was to be the successor of the PKI. This definitively alienated Tan Malaka and his followers as the PTI rejected collaboration with Muslims towards independence, setting the stage for a permanent split in Insulindian socialism."
POLITICS_SEMAUN_DESC:0 "While many other Insulindian independence leaders avoided deportation by the Dutch, a group of vocal trade unionists lead by Semaun were caught trying to organize a trade union meeting in Surabaya and deported to the Legation Cities. From this exile Semaun grew in power by drawing attention to the miserable working conditions in factories. As his trade union was becoming more and more popular with Malayan immigrants, distance support from Sarekat Islam dried up. The mantle to uphold trade unionism was picked up by agents of the Third internationale, who assisted Semaun in founding the PVI. Now, Semaun's dramatic return has brought new issues that integrating with a political left that distrusts him."
POLITICS_WESTERLING_DESC:0 "Out of all the nations for Westerling to land in, Insulindia was his last choice, although he had adopted Islam at a young age, his relations with Sarekat Islam and leftism couldn't be worse. His unit in Insulindia was both famous and infamous for their discipline and lack of emotions in carrying out their tasks. In the utter chaos of strife that engulfed the nation. Westerling emerged as a very much foreign influence within the nation of many foreigners. That has given Westerling an sort of outsider edge that allowed him to crawl to the top of the heap."

## Ireland ##
POLITICS_MICHAEL_COLLINS_DESC:0 "Michael Collins is the saviour and national hero of Ireland, with a combination of popularity and rigged elections keeping him in power. Born in Cork, Collins fought in the 1916 Easter Rising and afterwards became the president of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. During the war he organised the IRA into an effective guerrilla force, seeking to avoid the mistakes of 1916. In 1921 he was sent to negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Although by threatening to continue the war with German backing he was able to acquire all thirty-two counties in the treaty, he was unable to secure a republic, with the British fearing that an independent Irish republic would immediately become a German base. When he was expelled from Sinn Féin by Éamon de Valera he managed to form his own party, Fine Gael, which quickly overtook Sinn Féin in popularity. After the British Revolution he declared an independent Republic of Ireland and defeated a Unionist uprising in Ulster. Now with the Second Weltkrieg approaching Collins advocates revitalising Ireland's economy and military in order to assert Ireland's independence."
POLITICS_CATHAL_BRUGHA_DESC:0 "Born Charles William St. John Burgess of mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage, and later changing his name after joining the Gaelic League, Cathal Brugha is a war hero from the Easter Rising and leader of the rump Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He, already being a staunch rival of Collins during the War of Independence, became leader of the democratic opposition, a coalition of democratic parties opposing Collins, although he has increasingly become a figurehead to rally around in his old age as a new generation rises in the Republican movement. He and his party, bolstered in strength by many ex-Labourites following the 1923 ban after Larkin's failed uprising, advocate a social democratic Ireland as per the Democratic Programme of 1919, and a pro-German alignment to oppose Ireland's enemies in Britain and Canada."
POLITICS_FRANK_MACDERMOT_DESC:0 "Frank MacDermot is the youngest son of Hugh O'Rorke MacDermot, the Prince of Coolavin. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps during the Weltkrieg. Afterwards, he emigrated to America only to return to Ireland after the American economic collapse, and joined the anglophile National Centre Party, eventually becoming its leader due to his great oratory skills. A persistent critic of both the Collins' government and the democratic opposition's sympathies towards isolationism or Germanophilia, he is a strong advocate of a pro-Entente policy and rapprochement with the Unionist community."
POLITICS_JIM_LARKIN_DESC:0 "James Larkin, born in England before moving with his family to Ireland grew up in poverty and became a trade union organiser and formed the Labour Party with James Connolly, most famously participating in the failed Dublin Lockout of 1913. After the failure of the lockout, he moved to America and became a member of the Socialist Party of America. Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists and took control of the Labour Party, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand and the Labour Party was banned, leading Larkin to go into hiding with the help of the Commune of France. The Irish Citizen Army suffered dear for their loyalty, with their role in the Easter Rising being erased from the official history and their founder James Connolly's role downplayed."
POLITICS_GEAROID_O_CUINNEAGAIN_DESC:0 "Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin is a radical Irish language scholar, born in Belfast to a middle-class Catholic family, he joined the Army Comrades Association and managed to work his way up to Minister for Justice of Ireland as a result of his charisma, leadership and radical ideas which attracted the interest of ACA leader Eoin O'Duffy. As Minister for Justice, he passed laws repressing syndicalism as well as anti-traveler settlement laws against the Pavee community, as well as using his influence to encourage the Irish language. He also maintained links with the Romanian Iron Guard, expressing sympathy for establishing a similar regime in Ireland. To this end, he formed his own party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe that would revive the Irish language, ban the English language after a period of five years, and establish strong anti-syndicalist and anti-Semitic policies."
POLITICS_PADRAIC_O_MAILLE_DESC:0 "Pádraic Ó Máille was one of the founding members of Sinn Féin and a member of the Irish volunteers, and leader of the radically Catholic and anti-syndicalist Irish Christian Front, supporting Catholic corporatism and an alliance with the Spanish Carlists. As a result of his anti-syndicalist views, he almost fell victim to an assassination attempt by the ICA in 1932, but managed to survive despite being badly wounded."
POLITICS_BETTY_SINCLAIR_DESC:0 "Betty Sinclair, born to a Church of Ireland family in the Ardyone area of Belfast, became a millworker after leaving school and soon became an active trade unionist, drifting into the underground Irish Citizen Army and eventually rising in its ranks to become a leader of its political wing Saor Éire."
POLITICS_SEAN_LEMASS_DESC:0 "Seán Lemass was a volunteer during the Easter Rising and War of Independence and rose to become the head of the CPNH party, another breakaway party following the decline of Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish treaty. Lemass is an advocate for industrialisation and while he is a believer in capitalism, he also believes that normalising relations with the Union of Britain could have a beneficial effect on Irish trade and the economy. He is in favour of a flexible Irish foreign policy depending on the nation's needs, contrasting the CPNH from the other democratic parties who have their own biases in regards to Irish foreign policy."
POLITICS_DE_VALERA_DESC:0 "Eamon de Valera, born in New York to a Spanish father and Irish mother and taken to Ireland at the age of two, was a commander in the Easter Rising and a political leader during the War of Independence, however ending up slipping into political irrelevancy due to some poor political moves and misfortune following the Anglo-Irish treaty, having expelled Michael Collins from the Sinn Féin party despite Collins' incredible popularity, and then left SF himself later due to the influx of ex-Labourites into the party after the 1923 ban of the Labour Party as well as disputes with nationalists preferring a pro-German alignment which were in contrast with de Valera's belief in isolationism and neutrality. His breakaway party, Fianna Fáil, ultimately failed to be a success, becoming a minor party in the democratic opposition..."
POLITICS_SEAN_MURRAY_DESC:0 "Sean Murray is the leader of the Revolutionary Workers Group, and a believer in Marxist-Leninism akin to the Jacobins of France and the Soviets in Russia. During the War of Independence, he served in the IRA and was detained in the Curragh camp. He disagreed with the Anglo-Irish treaty and participated in the 1923 attempted uprising by the ICA, fleeing to the Commune of France after its failure, meeting with many French Jacobins while there and adopting some of their ideas. He later returned to Ireland to secretly continue agitating against the Irish government."

POLITICS_AZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "Perhaps it was cruel fate that Saud bin Abdulaziz incurred the wrath of an Emir named Abdulaziz ibn Saud. Saud bin Abdulaziz was no stranger to strange and terrible events. The young Emir's crowning at age ten a machination of the Al Sabhan family, his maternal family. He witnessed as a young man the death of famous British Explorer William Shakespeare without ever realizing the humor in his name, or that his death would leave the Rashids with no allies during the Weltkrieg. Despite squabbling, the loss of the Rashid army to British maxim guns and a betrayal by his cousin, the Rashid family survived. A head on his shoulders allowed him to secure a protection deal with the Emir of Kuwait, the leader of the Howietat, and an unsteady peace with Nejd. Now this Emir is grown and ready to lead Arabia through the violence and betrayal towards a brighter future."
POLITICS_ABDULAZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "Born to a naïve Saud bin Abdulaziz aged only 20. Abdulaziz bin Saud did not know the harsh tent his father grew up in. when Abdulaziz's time came for military service, he chose instead to travel. On his personal pilgrimage on a horse with no name, he observed the changing world of warfare in Egypt and Constantinople. He returned to Ha'il not in a tawb, but in a fashionable black uniform ordered from Germany. Now that Saud bin Abdulaziz is dead, his son has determined to avenge his family and end the Saud feud once and for all."
POLITICS_GHAZI_DESC:0 "The only son of the late Faisal bin Hussein, Ghazi escaped the wrath of the Turks in Hejaz by hiding in El Esah with his cousin Zeid bin Hussein. In El Esah, Ghazi was cared for by the remaining forces of Lawrence's rebellion, but financial assistance from Britain dried up in 1926. This left Ghazi to seek protection from Ottoman soldiers with the Howietat. This led to a temporary truce between the Rashids and the Hashmites when the Howietat were admitted into Jabal Shammar. The influence of Ghazi's name is still strong, as well as the legacy of the Arab Revolt among Bedouins yearning for freedom. Thus, it was Ghazi's triumphant return to Mecca after the fall of the Ottomans that restored the greatness of his name."
POLITICS_SAEED_DUBAI_DESC:0 "Where war and rivalry only led to the stagnation of Arabia, trade and deleation will restore. This came from a speech given by the Emir Saeed al Maktoum upon receiving his office. His term as Emir of Dubai was one of exemplary diplomacy and a care for his peoples' wellbeing. Submission to the Sauds over a bloodbath in the 1920s, creation of economic ties to India when pearling failed the emirate, and finally a promise of peace. His dynasty being unilaterally more wealthy than the Rashids or Hashmitie may of helped as well."
POLITICS_SHAKBUT_IRQ_DESC:0 "The House Al Nahyan was stuck in the crossroads of the Saud Rashid war. Their cities taxed cruelly by the Sauds, and thier commerce stunted. This destruction resolved Shakhbut Al Nahyan to formulate an economic plan for recovery involving western economists. This plan was presented to the Emirs, and early successes paved the way to Shakhbut's election. Al Nahyan weaves in his speeches the tales of how his ancestors of the Bani Yas migrated to the coast and found a land suitable to grow. Shakhbut's personal reputation among the Emirs is outstanding, and is only corrupted by the schemes of his own family. Shakhbut is confident that his reputation can save him from the machinations of family politics."
POLITICS_ABTAN_IRQ_DESC:0 "Atban was the one-time rival and now successor to the famous soldier and Sheikh Auda abu Tayi. When Auda's ambitons failed, he retreated from Aqab into the Al Nefud. The Howietat's livestock starved, wells were denied to them. In desperation Atban ibn Jazi choose to again put aside his rivalry for the sake of thier people and seek aid from the Rashids. This bid was successful, and Atban became the representative of the Howietat. Auda's and his reputations for joining the Arab Revolt and facing the harshest of the Turkish reprisals made Atban a surprisingly good candidate for Emir. Atban challenged the Emirs to live among their own, and was rewarded with cooperation."
POLITICS_SABAH_IRQ_DESC:0 "The Emirs of Kuwait began the century by setting the Rashid Saud conflict in motion, and it has finally paid off for them with the ascension of Jabe Al Sabah. It was Jaber's father who gave the Sauds arms and men in 1906 to retake Riyadh, a decision that would come back to haunt his son. The Ikhwan, Ibn Sauds frenzied soldiers attacked Kuwait when the British left, leaving devestation along the 1st Ring Road. Al Sabah prostrated himself to the Rashids, who forgave him and announced their protection of Kuwait. Now the Sabah are owed favors from the Rashids accrued during wartime, who exchanged this debt for a promise to elect Jaber al Sabah. Jaber himself reminding the emirs that he was first into battle on his horse against the Sauds, and that he alone could lead the charge against the Ottomans."

As both militarists and a resurgent left thrive amidst mounting domestic chaos, the Emperor remains silent, his role unclear and undecided. However, when and if the Emperor does make his move, it will no doubt be decisive."

POLITICS_BAKR_SIDIQI_DESC:0 "Unlike many Kurds that joined the Ottoman Army's special Hamidiye units, Bakr Sidqi joined the general army alongside Arabs in after training in Istanbul. This slot allowed him to gain allies within the Ottoman command throughout the Weltkrieg. After many divisions of the Ottoman 4th Army were discharged in 1921, Sidqi managed the welfare of both Arab and Kurd troops in Kirkuk. Sidqi cultivated a loyalty in his men towards him above official orders, which only increased when military pensions were cut in 1922. When the Assyrian rebelled in 1925, Bakr personally led his troops through towns killing soldiers and civilians alike. It was this ruthless efficiency and the recent desertion of the Hamidiye that gave Bakr an informal rule as military governor of the Mosul Vilyet. Bakr's aim is to subordinate the Kurdish tribes under his military clique with the help of Arab and Turkish soldiers."
POLITICS_BARZANJI_DESC:0 "Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî is the leader and patriarch of the Berzincî clan living to the north of Mosul. Although Mehmûd himself is Sunni, his ancestor Musa Kazem of the Twelver Shia gives him authority over Kurds in Ardelan. Mehmûd has spent the last decade gathering arms and supporters from Iranian Kurdistan for revolt. This revolt is planned the same way prior Kurdish revolts have, and the incredible success has bolstered Kurdish claims that their dynasty is as legitimate as the Qajars or Osman."
POLITICS_BABA_SHEIKH_DESC:0 "Nominally a citizen of Iran, Haji Bana Sheikh was a religious leader for the Mahabad province of Persia before the Weltkrieg. His position as a Sheikh only recognised by the Kurds in Mahabad, in which he was considered a moderate Shia leader. When the Russians entered Kurdistan, he formed the Alliance of Islam Committee to seek cooperation with Iran and Azerbaijan. Haji cultivated an ally in General Reza Khan, which has finally paid dividends in Persia's triumph. Haji collaborated with the exiled Mistefa Barzanî in 1932 to establish the PDK, although they soon clashed over whether the party would support Iran's claims or not. Haji's pro Iran position and Reza's support led to a breakdown of this coalition in 1935, though both leaders stay in touch."
POLITICS_MIHEMED_DESC:0 "It was only after the fall of the Soviet Union that Qazi Mihemed had realised his calling was socialism. Born into a rare Kurdish aristocracy and destined to be a poet, Qazi published his poems in Kurdi and Farsi, drawing the ire of the Qajars. His poems never reached the West, as the Khoyboun refused to publish his work. When internationalism finally came to Kurdistan, his works were found in the hands of socialists and he was found and uplifted from a jail in Sanandaj to realise the Kurdish destiny. Unlike most Levantine socialists, he rallies the Kurds in a united faith in Allah instead of nationality."
POLITICS_MUSTAFA_BARZANI_DESC:0 "A relative of the Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî, Mistefa was only five when his family was imprisoned by the Ottoman military. Spending the majority of the Weltkrieg in hiding with his remaining family, Mistefa first became involved in his brother Ehmedê's milita in the 1920's. Ehmedê's militia attempted to steal arms from the Ottoman 4th Army in 1925, leading to Ehmedê's capture and execution. Mistefa fled with the remainder to Azerbaijan, where he joined Haji in establishing the PDK. Mistefa was disturbed to find the Haji had allies in the Persian military, and lobbied for the party to turn away from secularism and cooperation with Iran towards total autonomy and Barzanî tribal laws. Officially Mistefa and his allies are the leaders of the PDK."
POLITICS_SHEIKH_SAID_DESC:0 "Follwoing the end of the Ottoman Caliphate during the War in the Sands, many Kurds formerly belonging to the Hamidiye were discharged without pay. Those soldiers returned to find the Sidqi clique had slandered them as traitors. The Hamidiye moved into the Turkish side of Kurdistan, among the Zaza Kurds and Alevi. Among them was the Azadi Sheikh Said, an adept soldier who felt that the Ottomans were betrayed by secularists. His anti-secular position may have alienated the Iranian and Iraqi Kurds, but the Zazas rallied around him. Said reorganised the Hamidiye along with even Turkish volunteers into a fighting force to restore the Caliphate. Said himself was a Naqshbandi Sufi, who felt that Egypt had abandoned the path, and Salfis posed a threat to Sufi existence."
POLITICS_RIZA_DERSHIMI_DESC:0 "Karuman is a member of what had been a Ottoman loyalist family. The Bedirxans had ruled Bohtan for a century leading up to their independence activities. Compared to many other Kurdish nationalists, Kamuran had traveled to Britain prior to their revolution to establish a support group for Kurdish immigrants. His experience in Turkish law allowed him to arrange for people to leave Kurdistan for Britain until 1924. Following the revolution, Kamuran worked in the Commune of France developing new alphabet based on French to enable Kurds to spread their message internationally. This work was allowed despite his dealings with the former empires, until 1929 when his residency was revoked. This turned him against socialism, and his publications made out of Turkey reflected this. He is brought in as a competent economist and intellectual President of Kurdistan, in order to give dignity to the post."

POLITICS_AHMED_SHARIF_DESC:0 "The third-generation ruler of the Senussi Oder of Tripolitania, Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi inherited a precarious role from his father, Muhammad Idris. Compliance with the Ottoman Caliphate was never fully embraced by the many Sufis in Tripolitania. The Weltkrieg broke the Senussi solidarity, and Ahmed Sharif fell out of favour to his cousin Idris, who was declared Al Mahdi as Senussi during the crisis. Thanks to an army raised by Ottoman General Nuri Killigil, Ahmed Sharif was able to oust Idris and force him into exile in Egypt. Italy's dissolution provided the prextext to invade Fezzan, and thus Ahmed Sharif became the first King of Tripolitania under Ottoman protection. A newfound hostility has found Ahmed adrift from his former allies in Al Ahzar university in Cairo, with his subordinates slowly being replaced by Turkish yes men and foreign trained intellectuals."
POLITICS_RAMADAN_SEWEHELI_DESC:0 "A survivor of the Republic of Tripolitania, Ramadan was forgiven by the Senussi Order due to his popularity in Tripolitania and was able to get a minor post in government until today. Through international assistance, Ramadan has recreated the Republic to represent all Libyan people oppressed and divided. His policies towards modernisation has drawn a lot of critics, especially his decision to mandate Italian over French as the second language of Libya."
POLITICS_SHARIF_GARIANI_DESC:0 "Hailing from a pious Senussi family in Bayda, Sharif El Gariani served as a Senussi leader and took an orphan named Omar Mukhtar into his order after Omar's family had died. Sharif came to regret this in 1911 when the Italians came to Cyrenica. A pragmatist and a pacifist, Sharif yielded to the Italians. His ward Omar instigated the people of Bayda into resistance against the Italians and Sharif. Omar's loyalists left Sharif to tend to the casualties of war, these victims would later remember Sharif's dedication to survival, and elected him leader of the Republic. Sharif has renewed his dedication to the Libyan people, and lamented that Omar could have been a greater leader if he cooperated with the wider world."
POLITICS_HUSSEIN_MAZIQ_DESC:0 "Born at the tail end of the Italian occupation, Hussein Maziq was the son of a patriotic resistance fighter in Benghazi. Maziq's family submitted to the Senussi order when Idris reclaimed the land from the Italians, and were put in touch with the legendary commander Omar Mukhtar. Maziq covertly supported Idris in exile, and simultaneously educated himself in Italian and French to work with industrialists. When the Second Weltkrieg came to Tripolitania, his organisation helped people evacuate to Algiers. Now this reputation has become known, and the grateful people of Libya have elected him President."
POLITICS_ABU_MENIAR_DESC:0 "Among the Qadhadhfa, very few would have expected an illiterate Bedouin to rise in the alien ideology of socialism. But when the Italians were occupying Qasr Abu Hadi, the illiterate Abu Meniar bought schoolbooks in Italian. His journey towards literacy in Italian continued after their army retreated, and his fascination with changes happening in Europe led him to move his family to Tripoli in 1923. Tripoli being the centre for Italian expats, Abu Meniar began reading Il Popolo d'Italia. Mussolinis strive for the unity of Italian people to overcome poverty led Meinar to ingratiate himself with the right people. Upon the rightful succession of the Internationale, Abu Meinar became their most trusted associate."

Škirpa and a number of minor disgruntled officers formed the Iron Wolf Organisation, a National Populist paramilitary fighting against German rule and the Slavic minorities within the Kingdom, as well as the Party of Lithuanian Interests as the movement's political arm.

Even though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, it's unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him. And Karl Gero is as much of a foreigner to them. It's hard to say if Mindaugas III would survive even a day on the throne without the Kaiser backing him from the shadows."
POLITICS_KAZIMIERAS_II_DESC:0 "A Polish-Lithuanian aristocrat from Kretinga, Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, now Kazimieras II, has committed the greatest sin possible in the eyes of the common Lithuanian - selling out to the Russians and giving up his nation's sovereignty to return the country under the hated eastern tyrant. This event has tainted his image to his people forever, and even though Tiškevičius is a capable administrator, a bright mind and even feels some compassion for the people he rules, his rule over Lithuania is tenuous at best."

A committed nationalist, he advocated the national self-determination of Lithuania in Saint Petersburg; with the establishment of the German led Lithuanian puppet government following the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Voldemaras returned to his homeland to again fight for its independence. As head of state, Voldemaras is likely to pursue an ultra-nationalist agenda which promotes the superiority of the Lithuanian people and devotion to the state."

Zapata, however, faces strong opposition from other socialist factions, as well as remnants of the old regime."
POLITICS_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "General Plutarco Calles has seized control of the Mexican government.

POLITICS_STERNBERG_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', was distinguished in the Russian civil war for his sadistic cruelty and zealous devotion to monarchism. In 1921 Ungern and his "Asian Division of Cavalry" invaded Mongolia, then under Chinese republican control, and established an independent Mongolia with Ungern as regent, and then monarch. The 'Mad Baron', speculated by many Mongolians to be the reincarnation of Genghis Khan, now strives to unite the Mongolian people beneath his banner, and perhaps one day restore Mongolia to its medieval glory."
POLITICS_STERNBERG_KHAN_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg has united the Mongolian people and proclaimed the formation of a new Mongolian Khanate with himself as Khan. With a nod to his supposed status as the reincarnation of Genghis Khan himself, Sternberg has taken the regal name Genghis Khan II. The new Khan rallies then Mongolian tribes to his banner, and the nations of Eurasia look warily upon his growing host."
POLITICS_BORIS_REZUKHIN_DESC:0 "Boris Rezukhin, former right hand of Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, has, with the death of Sternberg, ascended to the Mongolian throne. Rezukhin faces opposition from many Mongolians, believing Rezukhin to be responsible for the death of the nearly divine Sternberg. Rezukhin must now establish his legitimacy, and perhaps accomplish what Sternberg could not: the restoration of Mongolia to its former glory."
POLITICS_CHANGKYA_KHUTUKHTU_DESC:0 "Lobsang Pelden Tenpe Dronme, the Seventh Changkya Khutukhtu, fled from inner Mongolia to Mongolia proper with the expulsion of the Chinese by Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. His position within Gelug Buddhism and support for Sternberg's claims of divinity legitimised Sternberg. The Seventh Changkya Khutukhtu has now become regent of Mongolia, promising to care for the throne and the country until a spiritual successor to Sternberg is found."
POLITICS_ZHELNE_KHATUN_DESC:0 "Zhelne Khatun was the wife of Roman von Ungern-Sternberg until Roman's death. She has become queen-regent of Mongolia, ruling in her son's stead until he is old enough to succeed his father. Rumours abound, however, that Zhelne was involved in the death of her husband, undermining her authority."
POLITICS_GENGHIS_KHAN_III_DESC:0 "Theodor von Ungern-Sternberg, has succeeded his father to the Mongolian throne, and taken the royal name: Genghis Khan III. While many Mongolians mourn the death of their Khan, they see in his son the opportunity to continue the project of national restoration that led to the establishment of the new Khanate."
POLITICS_TRIBAL_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "With the death of Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, many of the nomadic tribes of Mongolia united in opposition to the Russian dominated Mongolian military, who they believed responsible for Sternberg's death. These tribes, with the defeat of the military, have now formed from among their leaders a council to guide the Mongolian nation. Much infighting exists amongst the council, however, and many advocate the restoration of the monarchy."

He had never expected to see mutiny from his own ranks, never expected to see the red flag rising on top of fair Paris, and he had never expected to flee from France in a beat-up old steamboat to Algiers. The French National State is less than a shadow of the glory of the Republic of France that stood before, but something still lived in the hearts of the Marshal and all of those that lived in this France, and that was the insatiable desire for revenge and a return to their homeland. The Lion of Verdun has no other demands but one; that his body is buried in Verdun, on French soil; not in the sands of Northern Africa, and the Lion will pounce again, this time to finish the red traitors!"
POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "Jean III de Orléans, once the picture of aristocratic aloofness, was severely affected by the syndicalist revolution in France. As he fled to North Africa, he became convinced of the necessity of the monarchy in securing the future of the embattled France and its people. Working closely with Action Française, Jean presented himself as the champion of the people in the fight against syndicalism. With the restoration of the Orléans monarchy, Jean aims to destroy the Communards, and extend the monarchy's principled governance to all France."
POLITICS_NAPOLEON_IV_DESC:0 "Louis Napoleon IV Bonaparte is the symbol of a France renewed. Crowned in the Notre Dame d'Afrique with the same grandiosity as the first Napoleon in Paris, he represents the ambition of the restoration of France's old glory. Like his ancestor at Austerlitz, Louis Napoleon endeavours to strike a deadly blow to the heart of France's enemies."
POLITICS_PIERRE_FLANDIN_DESC:0 "Pierre Etienne Flandin reminisces of the France that was before the turmoil of the Weltkrieg and revolution. A devotee of laissez faire economics and quite socially conservative, but also firmly republican, Flandin's vision of France's future is equally a vision of the past he so cherishes."
POLITICS_ANDRE_MALLARME_DESC:0 "André Mallarmé is often smeared by his political opponents as foolishly idealistic. Mallarmé embraces such criticisms; indeed, he is an idealist, but to be an idealist, Mallarmé argues, is to subscribe to the worthiest of notions: liberty, equality, and fraternity, the rallying cry of France's first republicans. Mallarmé believes that though syndicalism is an affront to human dignity, the concerns of France's people must be not only tolerated, but considered. A liberal republic, to Mallarmé, is the only effective defence against syndicalism."
POLITICS_FERNAND_BOUISSON_DESC:0 "Fernand Bouisson, a deputy from the 'Bouches du Rhone' before the Weltkrieg and a Pied-Noir, was well suited for the political atmosphere of the exiled French Republic. Bouisson, a leftist with a disdain for syndicalism did not hesitate to publicly disavow that ideology in an address before the chamber of deputies. Bouisson is guided compassion for his fellow man, and the belief that all French should have their needs met."
POLITICS_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_DESC:0 "Charles de Gaulle, who once fought furiously against both the Germans and Communards, now, as president, battles for the fate of the French Republic. A protégé of Philippe Petain, de Gaulle advocates a strong executive as the only institution capable of guiding the wayward Republic back to prominence. As a leader of men, both in the field of battle and in the halls of the legislature, de Gaulle has proven capable."
POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "Henri VI de Orléans, though but a boy when France was swept up in the fires of revolution, still bears a scar on his forearm where a stray piece of shrapnel embedded itself all those years ago. The trials Henri experienced in his youth steeled his resolve to dedicate himself to France; though paternalistic, Henri is deeply personally invested in his people's wellbeing. As king, Henri seeks to be both France's sword and its shield in the struggle for its future."

## Nicaragua ##
POLITICS_AUGUSTO_CESAR_SANDINO_DESC:0 "Sandino's emergence as a minor guerilla leader fighting in the 1926 Liberal Revolution was completely unexpected, with his presence not really being noted until the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro, which he disagreed with. Beginning with a small guerrilla force of 300 fighting in the south, he intensely fought in the jungles, slowly weakening the United States Marines. However, he kept being pushed further and further south until he was forced to leave his force with Francisco Sequeira Moreno and retreat to Mexico. There, he met with socialist leaders such as Zapata and became known in the international community. He also became a member of the EMECU, a spiritualist organisation which believed in the founding of a universal commune under god. Returning to Nicaragua in 1931 with Zapata coming along, many rallied to his side and his forces grew bigger than ever, until he and his men managed to liberate Managua in January of 1932, forcing the United States to retreat. Now slowly gaining a mass following, his presidency is loved by many with some even going as far as to create groups in his name to promote him and his rule."
POLITICS_FRANCISCO_SEQUEIRA_MORENO_DESC:0 "Francisco Sequeira Moreno was born into a poor family like much of the families of Nicaragua, and has spent the majority of his life illiterate. Following the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro between the 'Liberal' revolutionaries and the United States, he emerged as a guerrilla leader fighting within the north of Nicaragua. Him and his regiment of 400 men killed many, but were forced to retreat south and fight on with Sandino. While Sandino was in Mexico, he bravely fought in in the south against the United States occupation until Sandino returned, and became one of the leaders in the push northward and the eventual liberation of Managua. Once the revolution ended, he ended up forming his own party known as the 'Partido Campesino de Nicaragua', focused on rights for the lower class and improving the education system. While also learning how to read starting in 1932(Something he still struggles with), he is an adored individual among many of the Nicaraguan lower class."
POLITICS_JUAN_BAUTISTA_SACASA_DESC:0 "Juan Bautista Sacasa was Vice-President of former president Carlos José Solórzano until he was overthrown in a coup by former president Emiliano Chamorro Vargas. After Adolfo Díaz rebelled, he was sworn in as president by Liberal revolutionaries in the south led by José María Moncada Tapia and assisted in the liberation of Managua. However, after the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro, he stepped down as president due to his disliking of United States influence and went back to exile in Mexico. Serving mainly as an observer in Sandino's revolution, he decided to return to Nicaragua around the same time as Sandino and was present for the liberation of Managua. With him and Sandino finding themselves agreeing on basic principles, Sacasa was able to form his own party known as the 'Partido de la Revolución Liberal'. Mainly supported by those who prefer traditional democracy compared to Socialist and the small higher class, he has surprisingly managed to gain a decent base of support and some dedicated followers of his cause."
POLITICS_ELILIANO_CHAMORRO_VARGAS_DESC:0 "Serving as President from 1917-1921, Vargas is a military man with an extremely controversial reputation. Initially supported by the United States in his first presidency and helping to negotiate a treaty that allowed the United States to build a canal through Nicaragua. His presidency was largely looked over besides succeeding to pay off a significant portion of Nicaragua's debts. However, despite his efforts, he failed to win the presidency in 1923. Following the 1926 election of Carlos José Solórzano, he couped the government, setting off the chain of events that led to Sandino's government. For this, some credit him as the beginning of the revolution while others discredit him as power hungry. All that matters now however is that his dream of returning to the presidency has finally come true."
POLITICS_ADOLFO_DIAZ_DESC:0 "Adolfo Díaz has been one of the main targets of a smear campaign from Sandino, and for not entirely wrong reasons. Helping put down liberal president José Santos Zelaya in 1910, he was sworn in as president with much help from the United States. Leading the presidency first from 1911-1917, he was the definition of an American puppet furthering the goals of American companies like the Tonopah Mining Company. In 1914, he suffered a liberal revolt which one part in many long years of the 30 year long US military occupation, with marines being forced to suppress the revolt. These marines stayed in Nicaragua for over a decade to keep order while also giving the US permission to build a Nicaraguan canal. However, after Chamarro's coup in 1926, the 2nd Marine occupation force swore him in as president. His attempts to suppress unrest failed, and he was forced to concede for new president José María Moncada. Ever since he lived in the US, until now. A foreign force has occupied the country, and he is once again needed to suppress the unrest that plagues the region."
POLITICS_ANASTASIO_SOMOZA_GARCIA_DESC:0 "Somoza started a humble life in Nicaragua like many others, gaining the rare opportunity to go to business school in Philadelphia, and there he married his future wife Salvadora Debayle Sacasa, niece of Juan Bautista Sacasa. From there he was able to work his way up the ladder until the liberal revolution in 1926. Unremarkable overall in battle, his real attention getter was his excellent English from America itself, working as the broker of peace between the liberal rebels and Americans. From there he managed to get further relations with the Americans, joining the newly formed Guardia Nacional until just before the expulsion of the Americans, he was named head of the organisation. However, once Sandino reached the capital, he was forced to retreat to Honduras who accepted him and the leftover of the Guardia with open arms. To his dismay, Juan Bautista Sacasa due to joining the Sandino regime forced his wife to divorce him. Wishing to reclaim his homeland and his wife, he has finally succeeded in his goals."

Despite being respected and supported by the Norwegian people, and his declaration in 1928 that he is also the king of the syndicalists, this republican movement renders Haakon's position all but secure."

Upon returning to Jerusalem, he saw that the Husayni family's aim for an independant Palestine was based on a conflicting promises and antisemitism. Although he himself was Muslim, he believed that the prevailing Palestinian nationalism would be hijacked by a foreign power. Thus, Raghib established his own branch of the Watani party in Jerusalem to counter this movement and the Husayni ambition."
POLITICS_AWNI_DESC:0 "A member of the Al Fatat since before the Great War, Awni assisted in the relief efforts in the Jordan Valley during the Officers Revolt of 1918. While other groups in the Jerusalem Vilyet rallied in the streets, Awni ensured that Yildirim never uncovered the Al Fatat members in Palestine. Now Awni finds himself in control of a vastly unprepared nation that barely knew of his work in the struggle for independence."
POLITICS_MUSA_AL_ALAMI_DESC:0 "Musa Al Alami was the son of the Mayor of Jerusalem, Faidi al-Alami. His upbringing in Jerusalem where Jewish and Muslim converge geve him an appreciation for a government that expedites trade and promotes economic prosperity. The waning power of the Ottomans made his continued allegiance to them impractical to these goals, so in 1926 Musa established Al-tanmiat to prepare cooperation with Zionist groups. Non-aggression agreements were honoured, and subsequent votes propelled Musa into office."
POLITICS_MUFTI_DESC:0 "The son of Jerusalem's mufti and a mortal enemy of the Nashashibi clan, Amin was always quick to deal. The Husayni family's ongoing anti-Zionist position was on the decline until Abraham Antebi was arrested by the Turks. Then sentiment began to turn in Amin's favour. Through deal making in Syria, Amin was able to provide homes for survivors of the 1918 Officers Revolt. The return of Antebi proved to be another boon, as the Yildirim that accompanied Antebi began a campaign to destroy all political dissident in Palestine. Arabs in Palestine flocked to Amin, and he continued to make deals on their behalf all the way into office."
POLITICS_ANTEBI_DESC:0 "Albert Antebi spent the first 40 years of his life trying to mediate the Muslim Jewish divide in the Jerusalem Vilyet. When the Jewish Colonisation Association told him to buy land in Jerusalem for Jewish settlements, he always paid the Arab landowners a fair price. His goal of a peaceful creation of Israel was destroyed when he joined Mustafa Kemal in the Caucasus. After nearly dying in an Istanbul prison, Antebi was released as a bargaining chip of the Yildirm Army Group. He was given the ceremonial title of General Governor of Palestine, the first Jew to be honoured by the Ottomans in centuries, and held in Turkish custody as a virtual prisoner."
POLITICS_HILUPAL_DESC:0 "Radwan became General Secretary of the Palestine Arab Workers Society after the Third Internationale voted for and funded it's reestablishment. Before this, the PAWS was in severe danger of bankruptcy in Jerusalem, as the Yildirim had seized their assets following the return of Antebi. Radwan has suggested to the Internationale that the Yildirim would crumble without Antebi if he were to disappear. This became unnecessary as he died along with the Yildirim Officers in the liberation of the Near East."

Thus, he avoided most of the trumoil of the civil war and the danger that the Papacy was under in its later stages. He was the first pope since the Unification of italy to give an ascension speech at saint peter's, as the pratice was abandoned during the ''Hostage Years'' under the Savoy monarchy. His papacy has been also marked by increasing tensions between factions in the Curia, and the troubled re-establishment of temporal authority. "

He was then sent to Europe as an observer during the Weltkrieg, but resigned his post when Leguía couped the democratic government.\n\nLeguía was quick to react to Benavidez return, imprisoning him and sending him along with other political prisoners to exile. However, Benavidez managed to organize a successful mutiny in the ship that transported them, escaping to Central America, where he'd support Sanchez Cerro's uprising and later taking an important role in Sanchez Cerro's government.\n\nWith Sanchez Cerro's death, Benavidez took advantage of the anarchy that ensued and became Cerro's successor, suspending elections and becoming Perú's new Caudillo. Benavides has adopted the motto 'Order, Peace and Work', rewarding generously displays of loyalty and punishing severely any display of dissent..."
POLITICS_VILLARAN_DESC:0 "Manuel Vicente Villarán Godoy was born in 1873 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated with a PhD in jurisprudence in 1895 from the 'Universidad San Marcos'. He became a teacher in that same university and would return to his educative role many times during his political career. He was named Minster of Justice, Cult and Instruction during President Leguía's first regime, and would become an active member of Peruvian politics until Leguia's coup in 1919. He was chosen as Principal for the San Marcos University, but rejected his position in protest of Leguia's takeover, and began writing three Manifestos, all of them praising the youthful fighting spirit of his students and warning of the danger that entailed having a Caudillo leading Perú. He was exiled in 1925, but would return in 1927, trying to stay away from politics. During Sanchez Cerro's government, he took part in the subsequent constitutional reforms, although he didn't defend some points that the new constitution brought up. Now that he's president of Perú, he'll take a pragmatic approach to the issues Perú faces, trying to compromise with the UR and focusing on investing in better services and education for the nation."
POLITICS_JOSE_DE_LA_RIVA_DESC:0 "Jose de la Riva Agüero y Osma was born in 1885 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. The grandson of the first Peruvian president, José de la Riva Agüero y Sanchez-Boquete, he graduated from the 'Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature, philosophy and law, and managed to get a PhD in jurisprudence in 1911. His first political move was to write an article criticizing Leguía's government in that same year, for which he was arrested, triggering the first ever student protest in the history of Perú, which demanded Agüero's release. Agüero was released, where he became a teacher in San Marcos, but when Leguia took over the government in 1919, Agüero wrote a manifesto defending the constitutional order and left in a self-imposed exile towards Europe.\n\nThat travel to Europe changed him, as he was forced to witness the European recovery from the Weltkrieg, as well as the Syndicalist uprisings. It's in these circumstances that he meets D'Annunzio and Italo Balbo, whose far-right philosophy began influencing the once liberal Agüero. He returns in 1927 to Peru, after Cerro deposed Leguia, and began working as a history professor at the 'Pontificia Universidad Catolica'. He at first saw in Cerro just another dictator, but a meeting he had with the Caudillo changed his mind, as his experience in Europe and relation with thinkers like D'Annunzio and Carlés quickly turned him into a friend and close advisor of Sanchez Cerro. Although the hispanist ideals Agüero had were too extreme for Cerro, he was named head of ministers. With Cerro's death, he became his legal successor in the UR, although Benavides took over the real power upon his death. Now that Agüero is in power, he'll try to take Perú in a radical new direction and return the old glory of the Virreynato back to Perú"
POLITICS_EGUIGUREN_DESC:0 "Luis Antonio Eguiguren was born in 1887 in the small town of Piura, Perú. He graduated as bachelor in literature and jurisprudence in 1913 and in Political Science and Administration in 1914. In 1930 he became the Mayor of Lima, but resigned a year later after discrepancies regarding the autonomy of the city's Instruction ministry, and his differences regarding Benavides's Autocratic rule. He left to Ecuador in a self-imposed exile after death-threats towards his family from radical UR members, only to return after Benavides gave signs of wanting to restore democracy to Perú, where the contacts he had gained him a place in the Partido Socialdemocrata. Now that he's President of Perú, he'll do his best to bring peacefully a welfare-system into Perú, trying to compromise with the APRA and the other democratic parties wherever possible."
POLITICS_UGARTECHE_DESC:0 "Jorge Prado Ugarteche was born was born in 1887 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. Son of Mariano Ignacio Prado, who was President of Perú twice in his life, Jorge studied in Law in the 'Universidad de San Marcos' from 1904 to 1909, and then joined the military academy after graduating, becoming lieutenant by 1914. He joined with his brothers to the Partido Civil in 1914, where they helped in the coup d’état that overthrew President Billinghurst. He would later become deputy for the Dos de Mayo province, but would be exiled with his brothers for opposing Leguia's regime.\n\nAfter the assassination of Sanchez Cerro, Benavides, who was a childhood friend of Jorge, recalled him from exile in order to help him in his rule. Jorge began a reform to free political prisoners and recall political exiles that were punished by Sanchez Cerro and Leguia's regimes. However, Ugarteche would be forced to resign due to internal pressure, and Jose de la Riva Agüero would take his place, reinstating the hardline policies against detractors of the regime. Disillusioned with Benavides regime, he formed the Movimiento Democratico with the support of his brothers. Now that Jorge has managed to become President, his belief in the free-market and pro-entente leanings will surely lead to a liberalisation of the Peruvian economy, ushering in a new era of economic prosperity to the nation."
POLITICS_CONSEJO_NACIONAL_DESC:0 "With Agüero's death, the Union Revolucionaria has been thrown into chaos. Factionalism has begun to crack the once unified UR, with many within it vying for power, most notably Luis Alberto Flores Medina, General Ureta Montehermoso and Carlos Miró-Quesada. As long as there's not an elected successor for Agüero, the council will lead Perú forward, albeit with plenty of internal difficulties, until this issue is resolved."
POLITICS_HAYA_TORRE_DESC:0 "Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre was born in the town of Trujillo, La Libertad department, Peru. He signed up for 'Facultad de Letras de la Universidad de Trujillo' when he finished high-school, but would later decide to study to become a Lawyer in the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in Lima. There he met Manuel Gonzalez Prada, whose anarchist thoughts influenced the young Raul. He joined several protests against the Leguia regime, which would decide to get rid of him by granting him a scholarship to France. However, this move would backfire on Leguia, as the revolutions in Europe would influence young Raul and his friend, Mariategui, towards Syndicalist ideals.\n\nHe would go to Mexico in 1924, and with other Peruvian syndicalist exiles formed the 'Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana' or 'APRA'. The APRA would focus on pan-Americanism (or as Raul liked to call it, 'Indo-Americanism') and fighting imperialism and the burgois oligarchy that had settled in the continent. He'd return to Perú in 1925, settling in the north of the country with his fellow Apristas. In 1929, Raul led the Trujillo takeover, when APRA forces took over the city and proclaimed a Trujillan commune that would be lead by Raul, and executing the local garrison. When the revolt was crushed, he managed to escape to Chile, where he'd join forces with Churata and González Prada in order to strengthen the APRA for a new revolution in 1931.\n\nNow that Raul Haya de la Torre leads Perú, he'll bring about his dream of a worker's utopia for Perú, whatever the cost may be."
POLITICS_CHURATA_DESC:0 "Gamaliel Churata, whose real name is Arturo Pablo Peralta Miranda, was born in 1897 in Puno, Perú. Churata formed several culturalist groups in his youth, through which he met Manuel González Prada, Raul Haya de la Torre, and most importantly, José Carlos Mariategui, who would become a close friend of Churata. He was exiled to Bolivia in 1917, but would return to Perú in 1925, joining up Mariategui in Moquegua as the first group of left-wing indigenist thinkers was formed. When Mariategui finally died in 1930 in Chile, Churata was appointed by his friend in his dying wishes as the leader of the 'Frente Tupacamarista'. In his new role as leader, he'd later gather in 1931 with Raul Haya de la Torre and Alfredo González Prada in order to form a United Front from which bring about the Peruvian revolution. Now that Churata leads Perú, he'll focus on restoring the Andinean cultural identity and purge the Spanish-descendant bourgeoisie from the government, bringing about a new culture and society for the now new country of Piruw."
POLITICS_GONZALEA_PRADA_DESC:0 "Julio Alfredo González de Prada y Verneuil was born in 1891 in Paris, France. The son of known Peruvian anarchist Manuel González Prada, he'd graduate from the 'Universidad San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature in 1910, and would later graduate as a bachelor in Jurisprudence, later achieving a PhD on said career. In 1919, Prada would become the intellectual leader of the newly formed 'Frente Armado Obrero', which would fight for better working rights in its most moderate form and for an outright revolution in its more radical members. Seeing the violence this group generated in Lima, Leguia decided to send the military to suppress the movement, ending the first Peruvian Syndicalist experiment. He then decided to retire from public life temporarily, gathering with other anarchists in Peru until the failed Trujillo rebellion forced him to go to Chile. There he joined forces in 1931 with Raúl Haya de la Torre and Gamaliel Churata with the goal of bringing the revolution to Perú. A staunch believer of Anarchism, now that Prada is in power, he will focus on bringing about his father's vision for a descentralized and free Perú."
POLITICS_MIRO_QUESADA_DESC:0 "Carlos Miró-Quesada Laos was born in 1903 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated as a Lawyer in Lima in 1932 and joined the Union Revolucionaria. His diplomatic ways with other members and professional handling of propaganda for the party made him quickly rise through the ranks, becoming one of the possible successors to Agüero. Now that Miró-Quesada is in power, he's bound to continue the status-quo Agüero created and keep working forward for Agüero's vision of a glorious Hispanic Perú."
POLITICS_FLORES_DESC:0 "Luis Alberto Flores Medina was born in 1899 in the small town of Ayabaca, Perú. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in the late 1910's. He staunchly opposed the government of Augusto B. Leguía, for Flores would be imprisoned. He was freed after a decree by Sanchez Cerro, quickly gaining Flores's loyalty, who joined the Union Revolucionaria soon after. He accompanied Sanchez Cerro in his tour through Arequipa, Puno, Cusco and Ica, and would later become deputy for the UR. After the resign of Francisco Lanatta, Flores becomes the president of the council of ministers. During his time as president of the council, the crews of the Peruvian navy ships 'Almirante Grau' and 'Coronel Bolognesi' mutinied with apparent APRA influence. While Flores didn't believe the crews deserved the death penalty, the martial court determined they were traitors and had to die, so he came to the island of San Lorenzo with the prisoners, where he'd lead the execution personally. It is said that Flores himself forced each sailor to dig his own grave before being shot, earning him a reputation for cruelty in the UR.\n\nFlores became a close follower of Agüero, although he considered the latter to be too conservative in his approach against the APRA. Now that Flores is in power, he'll bring about his vision for a corporatist and totalitarian Perú, free from the influence of the decadent APRA which he'll hunt down relentlessly. However, his rejection of all races outside of the Spanish-descendant Criollos is bound to shine through in his policies, and might upset the local native and Asian population..."
POLITICS_URETA_DESC:0 "Eloy Gaspar Ureta Montehermoso was born in 1892 in Chiclayo, Lambayeque department, Perú. He graduated as an artillery second lieutenant from the Escuela Militar de Chorrillos in 1913. After beginning studies in the Escuela Superior de Guerra, he'd be sent to Italy and France to perfect his ability as an artillery officer. A decorated officer, he joined the UR due to his ultra-conservative views and admiration for Agüero, even if they both had their differences. Now that Ureta leads the UR and Perú, he'll try to instill in the Peruvian society at large the patriotism and discipline he was taught as a cadet."
POLITICS_ODRIA_DESC:0 "José Manuel Arturo Odría Amoretti was born in 1896 in the city of Tarma, Junin department, Perú. He graduated the Escuela Militar as an infantry second lieutenant, where his grades were so high that he was granted an honorary sword, and named instructor for the school. He continued perfecting his military ability throughout his career, taking an important role in the war against Ecuador, but he never truly prepared to be a politician. As such, now that he's in power, he'll seek to restore the Peruvian democracy, but not before restoring stability to the country and enacting laws to prevent future Caudillismo. However, his rejection of the native population may cause trouble with the large Quechua-speaking minorities in the country...."
POLITICS_BUSTIOS_DESC:0 "Reynaldo Chukiwanka Ayulo Choquehuanca, better known by his regnal name, Pachacutec II, was born in 1914 in Lampa, Puno Province, Perú. The son of Francisco Chukiwanka Ayulo and considered one of the descendants of the Incan emperor, Huayna Capac, he has taken advantage of his father's popularity to rally the Indians to his cause. His father graduated as a lawyer in 1908 from the 'Universidad de Arequipa' and would go to Puno, Perú, where he began fighting for better rights for natives and created an alphabet in which natives could write Aymara, Quechua and Spanish, helping the native population to improve its literacy rates as these languages conflicted with the latin alphabet. Reynaldo became involved in French émigré circles and was influenced by the writings of Charles Maurras. Seeing the government mistreating the native populations, Reynaldo took over his father's institutions and began going from village to village rallying the natives for an insurrection to finally be free of the Criollo oppression."

POLITICS_POL_REGENCY_DESC:0 "Poland was reestablished by the Central Powers in formerly Russian lands after over a century of foreign rule. Competition between Austria and Germany for influence in Poland, both during and since the Weltkrieg, has left the regency council unable to perform its principle duty, the selection of a new monarch. The, so called, 'eternal regency' lords indecisively over a Poland which remains much the same as it was before the Weltkrieg - poor and restless."
POLITICS_ROMAN_DWOWSKI_DESC:0 "Roman Dmowski was a thorn in the side of Germany throughout the Weltkrieg. While many Polish nationalists embraced the Germans as liberators, Dmowski, wary of Germany's assimilation of Poles in its east, favoured the Entente. His Polish National Committee was recognized by the Entente as the legitimate government of Poland during the Weltkrieg. With German victory, Dmowkski was forced to agitate tactfully and in secret; now as head of state, Dmowski is poised to seek renewed Polish national glory."
POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_SIKORSKI_DESC:0 "Władysław Sikorski led legions of Polish volunteers against the Russian during the Weltkrieg; he proved a capable leader, but with the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Sikorski found himself and Poland betrayed by the very nations that labelled themselves its liberators. Following the war, Sikorski cemented his control of the newly established Polish military, and planned for a day when he could lead Poland into true independence. Now, it seems, that day has come; Sikorski has assumed control of the apparatus of the Polish state, and declared an end to foreign dominance."
POLITICS_POL_SEJM_DESC:0 "The Sejm is the lower house of the parliament of Poland. Historically, the Sejm was an assembly of clergy and nobility which, uniquely, elected the king of Poland. With no current head of state, the Sejm acts collectively as Poland's executive."
POLITICS_FELIKIS_DZIERZYNSKI_DESC:0 "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."
POLITICS_FRYDERYK_KRYSTIAN_SASKI_DESC:0 "Fryderyk Krystian Saski, born Friedrich Christian von Wettin, king of Saxony, has ascended to the Polish throne. Fryderyk Krystian's status as both king of a constituent state of the German Empire and Poland is alarming to many Poles, who think him subservient to the Kaiser. Subservient or not, Fryderyk Krystian's coronation does indicate increased German influence in Poland."
POLITICS_KAROL_OLBRACHT_HABSBURG_DESC:0 "Karol Olbracht Habsburg-Lothringen, Austrian by birth, is a stalwart advocate of Polish independence. When Emperor Karl plotted to annex Polish lands to Austria, Karol Olbracht advocated fiercely against it.

Though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Mindaugas has now also been crowned king of Poland, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'eternal regency'."
POLITICS_AUGUSTYN_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC:0 "Augustyn Józef Czartoryski, though not a descendant of any historical Polish monarch, has been enthroned as its new king.

Sapieha is a monarchist; though, he has clarified that the monarchy shall only be restored with the consent of Poland's people. Sapieha himself rules much like a monarch; he is paternalistic and supportive of the aristocracy."
POLITICS_MIECZYSLAW_MICHALOWICZ_DESC:0 "Mieczysław Michałowicz, once a socialist, became disillusioned with leftism by the Bolshevik revolution.

POLITICS_STANISLAW_WOJCIECHOWSKI_DESC:0 "Stanisław Wojciechowski, a political ally of Alexander Kerensky during the early days of the Russian Provisional Government, has achieved electoral victory in Poland. Wojciechowski, a self-described socialist, shuns the revolutionary ideas of the Communards and other syndicalist movements, and instead advocates liberal democracy with consideration and concern for all."
POLITICS_KAROl_RADEK_DESC:0 "Karol Radek, once the pariah of the Polish socialist movement, rose to prominence by acting as a liaison between Vladimir Lenin and radical German socialist elements. Radek fought alongside Lenin and Dzierzynski in the Russian civil war, and eventually returned with Dzierzynski to Poland, determined to rekindle the flame of socialism. With Dzierzynski's passing, Radek has emerged as his successor."
POLITICS_JAKUB_HANECKI_DESC:0 "Jakub Hanecki was the chief financial minister of the Bolsheviks from Lenin's return to Russia until the bitter defeat of the revolution. He fled the collapsing Soviet Russia under the cover of darkness, bringing with him troves of financial documentation and ledgers linking various foreign socialists to the revolution, and thus saving many from imprisonment or worse. Hanecki, with the death of Dzierzynski, has triumphed over his political rivals. He intends to inject much needed fiscal responsibility into the new socialist Polish government."
POLITICS_ROZA_LUKSEMBURG_DESC:0 "Róża Luksemburg's reputation precedes her; she is considered by many to the ideological progenitor of an entirely new strain of Marxism. Luksemburg, a Leninist, criticized the lack of internal democracy within the old Bolshevik party. She also advocates the necessity of a world socialist revolution; such is the only way, she argues, to secure the revolution at all."

POLITICS_DUARTE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "As agreed in the Pact of Dover signed by royalists in exile before the Restoration, Duarte II inherited the throne from the heirless Manuel II. Since he was crowned in 1932, King Duarte has looked to strengthen ties with the Brazilian Imperial Family and with the British in exile in Canada, while at home keeping an amenable relationship with the Integralists, who fully control his government; a situation he will seek to change if possible."
POLITICS_MARIA_ADLEAIDE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "Having taken up the crown after the second Regicide in 30 years, Maria III has dauting tasks ahead of her. The young Queen has always been popular when she was a princess, always looking to help people in need whenever possible. Her gentle and good demeanour may make her aggressive anti Integralist position seem surprising, but since taking the throne she has denounced excesses from that party, and her fearless attitude only helps her popularity"
POLITICS_MARIA_PUPPET_DESC:0 "As the recently installed Queen of Portugal and the Algarves, Maria Ana I seems content in her role of doing little actual ruling. Her priority is ensuring the preservation of the Monarchy and in restoring ties with the deposed royal family. Her husband's German nationality, once a liability that essentially locked her out of inheritance, may very well help in this endeavour"
POLITICS_ALEXANDRE_VIEIRA_DESC:0 "Alexandre Vieira is perhaps Portugal's most prestigious and respected leftist leader, which a marked and distinguished career dating back to the early years of the Republic. After being forced into exile in France after the Integralist takeover in 1926, said respect and former contacts, especially among anarchists and syndicalists, may be key to forming a stable coalition as the dust settles from the fall of the monarchy"
POLITICS_JOSE_CARLOS_RATES_DESC:0 "A veteran in the harsh struggle for Portugal's workers, Jose Carlos Rates entered the political scene in the first years of the republic as a syndicalist leader; however one that strayed far from the anarchist mainstream of Portuguese Syndicalists. Founder of the Portuguese Maximalist Federation, Rates believes in cooperating against imperalism in a wide front, but will likely have issues implementing Totalism in Portugal"
POLITICS_BENTO_ANTONIO_GONCALVES_DESC:0 "Bento is a long-time syndical leader, entering the political arena in the waning years of the Weltkrieg as the conditions for Portuguese workers worsened. As syndicalist repression grew, in 1925 he was forced to flee Portugal after a failed strike, which sought to emulate the English Revolution in Portuguese soil. Now returned after decades of exile, Bento has the daunting task of recovering Portugal ahead of him"
POLITICS_ANTONIO_RESENDE_DESC:0 "A staunch republican, Antonio was aggressive in its attacks against the restoration in 1922, which forced him into exile after he allegedly advocated for regicide, an accusation he to this day claims to be false. Exile has not been kind to public memory of the Porto politician, but no leadership arose in the PRED that can claim his ideological intensity or credibility, even as he is thankful for those who kept the flame of Republicanism alive in these dark years"
POLITICS_AFONSO_COSTA_DESC:0 "A leading figure in the First Republic, Afonso Costa has been long been deeply involved with the republican cause in Portugal, and he was one of the architects of that first revolution. The last leader of the former Republic, his prestige was kept intact even after decades of exile in multiple countries, and there is hope that this republic learns from the mistakes of the past. However, the man's advanced age and failling health may very well put said plans in jeopardy"
POLITICS_ANTONIO_GRANJO_DESC:0 "Antonio's current leadership of Portuguese Liberal Republicans very well stems for his actions, for he was one of the few who actively attempted to stop the Restoration by taking up arms and urging others to do the same. The years in exile have not been kind to the politician, whose sexagenarian appearance may very well be unfamiliar to those used to the image of the man who attempted to defend the Republic."
POLITICS_JOAO_CANTO_CASTRO_DESC:0 "The aging admiral's beliefs may seem paradoxical to foreigners, as he has far more in common with monarchists than republicans in Portugal's political arena. However, as he is once again deemed the only man fit to leader, he will try his utmost to be a competent captain of Portugal for one last time, and endeavour to crush those who wish to end Portugal as a nation from within such as Iberists and Integralists"

POLITICS_BORIS_SAVINKOV_DESC:0 "The leader of the extreme nationalist and populist 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii' (People's Republican Party of Russia) and its violent paramilitary organisation known as the 'Combat Squads', Boris Viktorovich Savinkov was originally a leading member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party before commandeering its rightist wing off into the NRPR. A skilled writer and demagogue, Savinkov harbours an intense hatred for the weakness of the left and holds grandiose dreams of restoring Russia to its role as the hegemon of reaction."
POLITICS_DMITRI_ROMANOV_DESC:0 "An influential figure among Russian aristocrats, cousin of the last Russian Emperor Nicholas II, Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich finds it very easy to manipulate the Russian political scene. A wide net of relations and acquaintances also helps him when it comes to international relationships. In internal policy, however, his lack of competence is only barely covered by his charm and personality."
POLITICS_DMITRI_ROMANOV_TSAR_DESC:0 "Numerous connections among the nobility, both Russian and foreign, help Emperor Dmitriy establish firm diplomatic relations with foreign courts and governments. His excellent grasp of media also gives him an advantage when it comes to establishing a positive popular image. In internal policy, however, his lack of competence is only barely covered by his charm and personality."
POLITICS_PAVEL_II_DESC:0 "Only 12 at the moment of his father's death, young Pavel II is very likely to become a puppet at the hands of the regency council. Still, it is obvious that he inherited at least some of his father's charm - which, if combined with a sufficient political capacity, may someday give him a chance for independent rule."
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_CON_DESC:0 "Restored by the consensus of all political forces in Russia, Kirill Romanov had to accept many limitations of his powers, enclosed in a renewed constitution. Even though he quickly adapted to the new situation, his old-school outlook on politics and internal relations are more then likely to spark tensions between him and the government."
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_ABS_DESC:0 "With autocracy restored after two decades of republican rule, emperor Kirill is perhaps the last Romanov to uphold the traditional image of a strong, decisive autocrat. While the Russian people hope for the years of anarchy come to an end, the international arena observes the situation with suspicion, fearing a restored, possibly aggressive tsardom."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_ROMANOV_CON_DESC:0 "Member of the post-revolutionary generation of the Romanovs, Vladimir has a completely new outlook on the constitutionalism than his father. A tactful and temperate person, he understands that Russia may not survive yet another revolution - and is willing to cooperate with all forces aiming for the well-being of the country."

POLITICS_PYOTR_WRANGEL_TSAR_DESC:0 "Vrangel's outlook on autocracy in Russia is simple - only with a strong rule one can protect the Empire from foes within and without. Ruthless against his enemies, Vrangel is loved by reactionaries and hated by both liberals and socialists. In international relations some perceive him as a strong man for difficult times - while others fear that one day he may become the new Gendarme of Europe."
POLITICS_ANTON_DENIKIN_DESC:0 "Anton Ivanovich Denikin was one of the more successful of the White generals during the Russian Civil War, besting both Trotsky and Makhno, before eventually capturing Moscow. Seen as a political moderate and a Kerensky loyalist given his supposed republican values and serf background, Denikin's true political motivation is pragmatic patriotism. Even though he supported Kerensky against Kolchak's attempted putsch in 1925, Anton Ivanovich has stated again and again that he will do whatever is necessary to restore and maintain Russian greatness."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Aleksandr Kerenskiy is one of the most notorious politicians in Russia, with whom the majority of the Russian population associates such events as the fall of the first Russian Republic, shameful second Brest-Litovsk peace treaty and cowardly foreign policy. However, the Russian economic boom during the NEP programme in 1925-1930, recognition of the land redistribution and recovery of the industry were also made thanks to Kerensky's internal policy. But the large political crisis of 1933-1935 has almost destroyed Kerensky's regime and even though Kerensky is approaching the fifteenth year as President of the Republic, his government barely controls the country. It is unknown if the President and his policy will maintain the order in the country or finally disappear in the past..."

However, this is little more than legal fiction, for he, and the remnants of the Royal Army who support him and fled the peniunsla to join him, have little love for the so called Federal Head in Naples. Closely aligned with National France, to the point claiming him to be a puppet would not be out of place, he also sees his homeland as under Syndicalist occupation and seeks to liberate, but he has also to deal with the ever contentious relationship between Exiles and Sardinians, who question the perfection of this fusion that established itself in the island."

POLITICS_SAUDI_DESC:0 "Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the mortal rival of many dead men, now turns his sights towards Saud bin Abdulaziz. This rivalry began when the young Ibn Saud was ejected from his tent in Riyadh by the Rashids. Never a pawn of Emirs, ibn Saud's father rallied the destitute men of the coastal Emirates to the great goal of his dynasty, Wahhabism. The Rashids were then ejected at the cost of many men, including their only western ally. Ibn Saud himself started many a feud the Saudis inherited, as he expressed hatred towards any Arab who turned their nose up towards Bedouins. Ibn Saud overcame this anger, and leveraged his past to negotiate the protection of the western Emirates after Britain left. However, this seed of anger had passed onto his men, who inherited his ferocity and may turn this youthful fury against him yet."

Unprepared for kingship, having previously been far down the order of succession, he is essentially a puppet of the Siamese Council of State run by his cousins. Educated abroad and commissioned in the British Army, Prajadhipok nonetheless genuinely cares for his people and works diligently to improve his subjects' lot." # Prajadhipok
POLITICS_RAMA_VIII_DESC:0 "Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, being barely a teenager and of low birth. He originally held the rank of 'Mom Chao', making him among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he has quickly won the hearts of the Thai people. Foreign observers, however, believe that he did not really want to be king that his reign would not last long. " # Ananda Mahidol
POLITICS_RAMA_VIX_DESC:0 "Bhumibol Adulyadej, known by his regnal name Rama IX has ascended to the Siamese throne following the mysterious death of his late brother, Rama VIII. Bhumibol Adulyadej has so far proven himself much more politically competent than his late brother, navigating the convoluted Siamese political landscape with seeming ease. Many speak of Bhumibol Adulyadej as the savior of the once embattled Siamese monarchy" # Bhumibol Adulyadej

With the full support of the Privy Council he has crowned himself as King Rama VIII, firmly establishing the Boripatr cadet branch as the new ruling house." # Paribatra Sukhumbhand
POLITICS_CHUMBHOTBONGS_PARIBATRA_DESC:0 "Chumbhotbongs Paribatra, known by his regnal name Rama IX, has succeeded his father, Rama VIII, to the throne of Siam. Chumbhotbongs Paribatra is something of a recluse, but still politically competent. He is a known patron of the arts, having converted multiple state-owned properties into museums, and has personally sponsored many great artists both in Siam and abroad." # Chumbhotbongs Paribatra
POLITICS_SUKHUMABHININDA_DESC:0 "Sukhumbhinanda, son of former King Paribatra Sukhumbhand (Rama VIII) and a lowborn woman, was legitimised by his brother King Rama IX due to the latter's inability to produce a male heir. He has ascended to the throne as Rama X. Sukhumbhinanda is a prominent philanthropist whose efforts to relieve Bangkok's poorest have garnered him much publicity. With Sukhumbhinanda's ascension much of the remaining public discontent with the monarchy has dissipated."

POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanomyong, also known by his ministerial title 'Luang Praditmanutham', immediately set out to better the lives of the Siamese people upon his appointment as a minister. His controversial 'Yellow Cover Dossier' outlined his political and economic reform agenda and divided the Siamese government, but the controversy only served to further Pridi's political career." # Pridi Phanomyong at the onset of the CW
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_REBEL_WIN_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanmoyong, previously known by his ministerial title Luang Praditmanutham, has become the Chairman of the Sapha Prachachon following a brief but bloodly Siamese Civil War. Panomyong's policies of economic nationalisation and radical parliamentarian reform may now continue, however challenges from more radical elements within Pridi's Sahachip Party have grown significantly. Despite his popularity, Panomyong struggles to maintain his authority even with his allies in the Navy." # Pridi Phanomyong after winning his rebellion

Together with Luang Wichitwathakarn and his allies in the military he has built his own cult of personality to sideline the Monarchy. He views the current state of Siam as an 'outdated relic of a bygone era' and intends to use his power to promote militarism and nationalism, proclaiming both to be additional essential principles of the modern nation." # Plaek Phibunsongkhram after Coup d’état
POLITICS_PHAO_SRIYANOND_DESC:0 "Police Chief Phao Sriyanond has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Soi Ratchakhru Clique.

Phao also believes the Siamese monarchy to be an antiquated relic which impairs the cause of nationalism, and is thus an avowed Republican" # Phao Sriyanond

POLITICS_ALI_SHIRE_DESC:0 "Having taken up the throne of the Warsangali Sultanate in 1897 after a protracted power struggle with his father Gerad Cali Shiire, he descends from a line of kings that has lasted almost 600 years in the Horn of Africa. While being nominally subservient to British interests, Maxamuud Cali Shiire's support of Abdullah Hassan, the Mad Mullah, was crucial in defeating Italy in Afrika during the Weltkrieg. A savvy political navigator, Maxamuud has united the sultanates of Somalia under a federal monarchy under his nominal leadership; but can a man who declared war against his own father for power be trusted not to infringe on constitutional prerogatives?"
POLITICS_BARRE_DESC:0 "A Marehan Darod hailing from the Ogaden, Siad Barre has always been a competent and enthusiastic officer. He is uncommonly young and surprisingly vicious with his enemies, and his ideological inflexibility certainly comes from his training from members of the Muslim Socialist Comitee. His vision of a Somalia united beyond clan bonds is one that is bound to find resistance at every level of Somali society"
POLITICS_HAAJI_MAHAMMAD_DESC:0 "Haaji Mohammed is the chief among a group of officers and intellectuals who defend the concept of a Greater Somalia above all else, and the unification of the people under one purpose. Despite his deep admiration for Abdullah Hassan, his group seeks completely detach Islam from the state, and such a measure is bound to unpopular at many levels of society"
POLITICS_JAMA_QUALIB_DESC:0 "Jama Abdullahi Qalib is a young liberal hailing from Hargresia. His faith on liberalism as the way to Somalia's future is admirable, but his readiness to work with foreigners has raised concerns on the populace, and so have his liberal ideas on the complete secularisation of the state"
POLITICS_ADEN_ADDE_DESC:0 "Born in 1909 in Beledweyne, Aden Abdullah remembers very well how it is to grow up under the thrall of Colonialism. His studies bring him closer and closer to Syndicalist ideologies, which he believes fit Somalia well; each clan is a trade union which works best autonomously, but most cooperate with its neighbours. He has been strongly influenced recently by French scholarship on matters of decentralised leadership, and hopes that he can ensure that Somalia's rough recent years can culminate in something good on the long run"
POLITICS_SHERMAKE_DESC:0 "A Majarteen from Mudog, Ali Shermarke is a competent young scholar, well versed in both Islamic, Federal and foreign laws. He wishes for a non-aligned and peaceful foreign policy, but his wishes may very well be overturned by the influences foreign powers exert now on Somalia"
POLITICS_BASHIR_YUSUF_SOM_DESC:0 "Hailing from the Osman Mahmoud clan of the Majarteen, Yusuf defends a more democratic and equal Somalia, even if he lacks the fervour for change that many of his colleagues do. His hopes are of a Somali Democratic Federation where the small clans and the city folk alike have their voices heard by the powers that be, and vows to fight poverty on rural areas of the nation"

## South Africa ##
POLITICS_JAMES_HERTZOG_DESC:0 "James Barry Munnik Hertzog first rose to prominence as a Boer guerrilla leader in the second Anglo-Boer war; defiant to the last, he resisted the British long after the war had been definitively lost. Even in defeat, however, Hertzog continued to champion the Afrikaner people. He rose to leadership of the Afrikaner dominated 'National Party', and in 1924, became South Africa's first Afrikaner prime minister. With the collapse of the United Kingdom the following year, Hertzog declared the independence of South Africa and seized the British colonies of Bechuanaland and South Rhodesia. Hertzog, as president of the new South African Republic, has been a proponent of segregation between South Africa's various racial groups, and has encouraged the disenfranchisement and resettlement of South Africa's already oppressed black population."
POLITICS_JAN_SMUTS_DESC:0 "Jan Christiaan Smuts, though an Afrikaner veteran of the Second Boer-War, had, by the onset of the Weltkrieg, become a staunch proponent of South African autonomy within the United Kingdom. During the Weltkrieg, Smuts led South Africa's armies against the Germans in Namibia and clashed with the famous Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck in East Africa. In defeat, Smuts continued for South Africa's future; Smuts and opponents of the ruling National Party, which had declared South Africa a republic, including many British South Africans, established the Dominionist Party to promote the restoration of British Dominion status in South Africa."
POLITICS_KING_EDWARD_SAF_DESC:0 "Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_NICOLAAS_HAVENGA_DESC:0 "Nicolaas Christiaan Havenga, once a loyal supporter of the James Hertzog and the National Party, and perhaps an even more radical Afrikaner nationalist, left the party over disagreements with its economic policies. He founded the 'Progressive Party' in opposition to what was, in his view, the regressive economic platform of the National Party. As president, Havenga seeks to deregulate foreign trade and promote the exploitation of South Africa's vast gold deposits."
POLITICS_DANIEL_MALAN_DESC:0 "Daniel François Malan, former editor of the National Party's newspaper, Die Burger, has outmanoeuvred rival James Hertzog to secure dominance of South Africa's nationalist faction. Malan is, even by Afrikaner Nationalist standards, a hardline proponent of racial segregation and the suppression of South Africa's black population. As president, Malan strives to transform South Africa into a nation completely by and for the Afrikaner people, and by nearly any means necessary."
POLITICS_HERBERT_STANLEY_DESC:0 "Herbert James Stanley, British-Rhodesian political leader, with the death of Jan Christiaan Smuts, has become governor-general of the Dominion of South Africa.

POLITICS_ALPHONSO_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Alphonso XIII of Bourbon, king from the moment of his birth in 1886, was, to popular contempt, restored to the throne of Spain in 1932. His second reign has been even more tumultuous than his first; republican, Carlist, and socialist dissidents all undermine his authority, and economic growth has stagnated. Spain, under Alphonso, has become a powder keg liable to explode."
POLITICS_JUAN_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Juan of Bourbon inherited a Spain divided, a Spain on the brink of the abyss. As the son and successor to the widely despised Alphonso, his reign will forever be marred by the specter of his father, but it is Juan, not Alphonso, who must lead Spain into a better future."
POLITICS_FRANSISCO_FRANCO_DESC:0 "General Fransisco Franco Bahamonde's widely noted charisma and uniquely Spanish machismo facilitated his quick ascention to leadership of the Acción Popular. Now Franco, as Spain's head of state, has the unenviable task of forging a broken nation anew. For such burden, none can deny that he is uniquely qualified."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_FERRER_DESC:0 "Miguel Cabanelles Ferrer, who commanded Spain's African colonial conscripts in the Rif war has risen to the forefront of Spanish politics through strict discipline and focus. He and his Falange Española, organised more like a paramilitary than a traditional political party, may be the only force capable of bringing some semblance of order to Spain."
POLITICS_GIL_ROBLES_QUINONES_DESC:0 "José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, a committed monarchist and militant Catholic, has risen to prominence in Spain. His firebrand speeches denouncing the Kingdom's enemies while extolling religious virtues might even appear radical to a Carlist; nonetheless, Quiñones stands defiantly at the helm of the troubled Spanish nation."
POLITICS_JAIME_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Jaime of Bourbon, second son of King Alphonso XIII, deaf and once considered likely to renounce any claim to the throne, has been crowned King of Spain. While not lacking in mental faculties, his reputation as an invalid precedes him. This unlikely King, however, must lead Spain into its uncertain future."

POLITICS_Gustaf_V_DESC:0 "Gustaf V Bernadotte was born in 1858 and was the crown-prince of Sweden and Norway from 1872. It is no wonder that he is a man of the old ways, as during his father's reign the King of Sweden acted both as head of state and head of government, with ministers held responsible only to him. However, just two years before Gustaf's ascension to the throne, in 1905 his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament.\n\nWhen Gustaf first took the throne in 1907 he also ended a Swedish tradition of roughly 700 years when he refused a coronation. As such, during his reign as a king, he never wore a crown. While at first ambivalent about the Swedish politicians he angered in February 1914, when the Swedish liberal government wanted to cut in military spending. After holding a speech condemning their actions, the liberal government stepped down and was replaced by civil servants appointed by Gustav himself. In the following 1917 elections the Liberals and Social democrats made heavy gains, but Gustaf still attempted installing a conservative government. However, they were unable to form a coalition and Gustaf realised he could no longer appoint governments of his own choosing. During the following reforms, he found himself forced to act upon his minister's advice, and not the other way around."

politics_nils_flyg_desc:0 "The figurehead of Swedish totalism, Nils 'Nisse' Flyg, is considered by many to be a colourful character. Born in the Stockholm working-class neighbourhood of Södermalm, Flyg has been active in the Swedish radical left since a young age. In 1917, he split off from the SAP with Zeth Höglund and Karl Kilbom to form the Swedish Communist Party, a brief experiment that soon failed when the Russian revolution was crushed. Nonetheless, the young Flyg would prove to be a force to be reckoned within the Swedish left.\n\nIn more recent years, Flyg distanced himself from his less radical comrades and took on the doctrine of total commitment to the Revolution propagated by the Sorelians in the Commune of France and Oswald Mosley in the Union of Britain, though adding his own unique values to it as well: Flyg is known to oppose notions of an indigenous socialist revolution in America and, ironic to his previous positions, Russia, believing that the revolution has to originate in Europe as it would otherwise take the shape of anti-European imperialism, noting on the side that neither Russia nor America harbours an orthodox totalist movement."

POLITICS_SWITZERLAND_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "Founded in 1848, the Swiss Federal Council is a seven-member executive council which serves as the collective head of state for Switzerland. Each council member heads one of seven different federal departments, and the position of Federal President moves between the seven Councillors every year, with the current year's Vice President serving as the next year's President."
POLITICS_BIRCHER_DESC:0 "A Germanophile and diehard anti-Syndicalist, Eugen Bircher is a physician by trade and invented several groundbreaking procedures dealing with arthroscopy of the knee. After the rise of Syndicalism in France Bircher largely gave up his medical work and founded the SVV, which quickly pervaded Swiss military and political circles as a counterbalance to the rising tide of Socialism in the nation."

A signatory of the Totalist charter, Oltramare's more extremist tendencies have caused a rift between his hardline faction the Union Nationale and the more mainstream Syndicalist elements within the nation."

After living half of his life abroad in the west, Antoun returned to his homeland in 1925 to find the dream of democratic Lebanon dead. In Lebanons's rubble, Antoun founded an organisation called Natural Syria, dedicated to a non-sectarian independent Syria that could stand against Ottoman and Western Imperialism. Sharing only a distaste for imperialism, Antoun rejected the message of the syndicalists as divisive and rejected the Ba'ath ideals. Antoun sees Natural Syria as the homeland of ally Syrians, Kurds, Iraqis and Lebanese regardless of race. In his writing, Antoun claims that he will merge the best parts of socialism, nationalism, and patriotism under the Zawbaa."
POLITICS_FAWZI_QUWU_DESC:0 "Captain of the 12th Ottoman corps of Mosul, Fawzi had proven his bravery to the Turks. Where many heard the call of Faisal's Arab Revolt, Fawzi heard only the commendations from General Otto von Kreiss. When the Turks were victorious, they made Fawzi a Pasha. Although showered with praise, Fawzi refused to call himself a Pasha. His current role as military governor is unique among the vilayets as he exerts considerable control over the soldiers in his command."
POLITICS_ADIB_BIN_HASSAN_SYR_DESC:0 "Sami Al Hinawi has spent his career avoiding the easy paths to power. Never renouncing his Arab name in the Ottoman Military, his loyalty earned him the right to use his birth name. The allure of the Arab Revolt never reached him in during his time in the Jerusalem Vilyet. A possible alliance between his officers and the emerging SSNP was rejected on the same basis that the easy way to power is a trap. Time will tell whether this stalwart commitment will pay off."
POLITICS_SHUKRI_QUWATILI_DESC:0 "Among the several branches of Al Fatat in the Arab world, none would be as successful as Syria's. This is due to the careful manoeuvring of their leader, Shukri al-Quwatli. Despite his exile from Syria twice, he has again returned and collects his allies in preparation for a new type of Republican government. Shukri's position in Syria is an intermediary between the liberal burghers and conservative landowners that hold judicial power in Syria."
POLITICS_SULTAN_ATRASH_DESC:0 "Sultan Atrash is relied upon by the Syrian people not because he is a great unifier. Atrash openly admits that he seeks autonomy for his Druze people against the wishes of his own allies. This push for autonomy of Syria's minority groups is however unilateral. Atrash wishes to rebuke pan arabism and protect Syria as a nation of minorities."
POLITICS_NAZIK_AL_ABID_DESC:0 "Once exiled to Cairo in the wake of a Turkish crackdown, Nazik al Abid has pulled off an incredible achievement other Arab feminists like Tarab Abdul Hadi could only dream of; for she was elected head of state of Syria. Her work establishing the International Red Crescent and her liberal position towards veils has finally paid in dividends for her and for women across Syria, as her notoriety has put her in a prime position to lobby for their rights in the country."
POLITICS_SABRI_ASALI_DESC:0 "Sabri al-Asali began as an Arab member of the Ottoman Parliament in the capital. Where many of this contemporaries joined secret societies and stocked weapons, Al Asali knew that legislation would lead to Syria's freedom. When the pen signed Syria's independence, he was in Cairo in Hal'il meeting with heads of state. It is through the outside in that Sabri al-Asali assumed power in Syria. He may be out of touch with the common Syrian, but his commitment to economic ties with the Arab world set Sabri apart from his peers."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A Sheikh is not the first person the International expected when they asked Syria to elect their first leader among the syndicates. While it is true that Muhammad al-Ashmar's first station was a Mufti, he is now a leader of the people. His influence within the mosques in reinterpreting Islamic law and rejecting Secular syndicalism in favour of voluntary Zakat from all sets him apart from any other branch of socialism in Syria."
POLITICS_MICHEAL_AFLAQ_DESC:0 "Michel Aflaq was in Paris during the Syndicalist revolution. Swept up in the socialist organisations, he joined the Commune's government as an informal student. There he studied trade unionism with Saladin al Bitar, and they both decided that Syria was ready for revolution in 1925. The revolution to be, a renaissance or Ba'ath, never materialised. Michel was unable to form trade unions in Damascus or Mosul, so he returned to Paris in 1930 abandoning the Ba'ath party. His return as of late as an emancipator and the forced creation of a trade union council in Damascus means his power is backed up by his superiors in the Internationale more than it is backed by Syrian supporters. This will not stop Aflaq from realizing the dream of Ba'ath however, a united Syrian proletariat."

POLITICS_ALEXANDR_KOLCHAK_DESC:0 "Once a polar explorer and commander in the Imperial Russian Navy, who had also fought in both the Russo-Japanese War and the Weltkrieg, Kolchak had tried to claim himself the 'Supreme Ruler of Russia' but failed to garner enough support. His relations with the newly created Russian Republic's government were quite hostile due to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which they had agreed to and signed, and had only worsened in 1925 after Kolchak's unsuccessful coup d'etat against the 'German lapdogs'. The rogue admiral managed to flee Russia and found shelter in the pro-Japanese state of Transamur. Now a puppet of Hirohito, Kolchak is trying to gather enough power and support to overthrow the government in Petrograd and crown himself leader of Russia."
POLITICS_SHUMYATSKY_DESC:0 "Boris Shumyatsky's parents were forced into exile in Siberia because they refused to leave their home. This incident has stuck with Shumyatsky, continually reminding him of the corruption within the Tsarist government based in Petrograd. A former Bolshevik, Shumyatsky was forced to leave Russia upon the conclusion of the Russian Civil War and has become an influential politician within Transamur. Despite his political views shifting towards the right, Shumyatsky continues to pursue the goal of turning Transamur into a welfare state. His past experience as a Bolshevik agitator has helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_MERKULOV_DESC:0 "A former leader of the pro-Japanese Provisional Primorsk Government, Merkulov's cabinet had been incorporated into Semyonov's Transbaikal state. Now, as Kolchak no longer stands in his way and democracy has finally returned to Vladivostok, Merkulov, a son of a humble peasant, is eager to lead Transamur to prosperity. His vast and personal connections with the people have helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_WOJ_DESC:0 "A leader of Czechoslovakian Legion and hero of the Russian Civil War, Wojciechowski has refused to accept the Brest-Litovsk treaty as legitimate. Outraged, he ceased all the contact with the government of the Russian Republic, and left for Transamur where he found many supporters. Formerly the right-hand man of admiral Kolchak, Sergei betrayed and killed his 'friend'. Less aggressive and ambitious than the rogue admiral, and a hardened veteran, Wojciechowski is now ready to advance West."
POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "An Ataman of the Baikal Cossacks, Semyonov and his boys had managed to establish a Transabaikal state, currently known as Transamur, in order to fight Bolsheviks who had been agitating in the Russian Far East. His newborn country was soon subjugated by Japan. When Kolchak's coup in 1925 had failed and the had rogue admiral had left Russia for Transamur, Semyonov was forced to resign and continue his career as military commander. However, the 'father-of-state' has managed to return, politically influential. Semyonov's only goal is to see Transamur prosper and, in order to do so, he is unwilling to wage uncertain wars."
POLITICS_YUI_DESC:0 "An old general, Mitsue is familiar with taking on command as he'd led the Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. A honourable war hero, he has been granted the ultimate gift from the emperor: to peacefully rule over the lands he'd conquered so many years ago. The old man is an isolationist and does not seek to wage any sort of war. With him assuming power as head of Transamur, the dream of a Greater Transamur has died."

In 1906, he joined a group of Romanian nationalists in the Budapest Parliament, becoming an important opponent of the Hungarian government, and fought for Transylvania's right for self-determination. Disappointed by the Austrian cause after Franz Ferdinand's assassination in Sarajevo he turned towards an advocacy of Transylvania's union with Romania."

An accomplished commander and a hero of the Weltkrieg in Austria, he was still unable to coordinate a defence against the rising republican and later syndicalist threat in he uneven terrain of Tuscany, and later retreated to Lazio to avoid being encircled. He never really saw the title of Grand Duke as much more than a promise for many years, but his long army career will probably have an impact in his reign. A pompous and proud man, he is eager to learn about the lands he now considers his, even if his sometimes obvious questions regarding landmarks make him almost feel like a noble a tourist rather than a Duke. Thankfully for him, a goverment of local officers and politicians oversee most of the boring bureocracy."

POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Borubon's last 20 years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsabilities of being a monarch of a soverign nation and the leader of the Italian Federation, at least in an interim fashion. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after 6 years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that his credit in this peace, and relative prosperity, if anything due to Sicily being the least war torn region during the brutal civil conflict. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many work to mantain, the matter of the constant syndicalist threat, especially towars His Holiness in Rome, and his lack of a male heir, weigh heavily on him. The creeping feeling of powerlessness, even now as he is a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."

POLITICS_VASYL_DESC:0 "King Vasyl I von Habsburg-Lothringen is regarded by most ethnic Slavs, Russians and Ukrainians alike, to be a humiliating symbol of foreign dominance. In fact, with political polarisation growing so rapidly in Ukraine, a disdain for King Vasyl is perhaps the only commonality amongst Ukrainians. With such opposition, a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_NIKITA_KRUSCHEV_DESC:0 "Nikita Kruschev, authoritarian socialist, has become the premier of Ukraine. Kruschev, born to Russian peasants near the current Russian-Ukrainian border, harbours a deep disdain for the landowning Kulaks; he plans to eliminate the Kulaks as a social class through forced seizure and collectivisation of their land. Such measures, however, are unpopular among all but a small number of Ukrainians, which may force Kruschev to compromise."
POLITICS_LEO_STEFAN_DESC:0 "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo's ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo."
POLITICS_DANIIL_I_DESC:0 "King Daniil Skoropadsky, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Daniil aims to bring stability and order to Ukraine, and decisively eradicate the Ukrainian socialist movement. While not openly hostile towards Germany, he seeks to assert Ukrainian independence and reorient the Ukrainian economy to serve Ukrainians alone."

After the death of his predecessor, Alexander Berkman, this fiery radical socialist took the reins of the American syndicalist movement, and he has led this organisation to great success. While this long path from journalist to President has brought him many enemies, it also brought him many allies. He is determined to become the American version of Sebastian Faure, the founder of the Commune of France - a charismatic, unifying Syndicalist demagogue who shall turn his country into what he perceives to be a perfect society."
POLITICS_JOHN_NANCE_GARNER_DESC:0 "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas and the new President of the United States. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, a fervent supporter of democracy. This Texan judge sees no reason in compromise with either the left or the right."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_1_DESC:0 "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States. However, before becoming president, he was best known as an engineer, businessman, and the man in charge of the "Commission for Relief" in Flanders-Wallonia. In addition to that record, he is also known for his two failed attempts to become the Republican nominee for President, losing once in 1920 to Leonard Wood and again in 1924 to Irvine Lenroot. Both Republicans would go on to lose their races, to Woodrow Wilson and A. Mitchell Palmer respectively. Hoover became the Republican nominee in 1928 as a compromise candidate between the Conservatives and Liberals within the party. With Hoover's victory in the 1928 Election, Republicans celebrated their victory, but their cheers would not last. As the United States was still in an economic slump, and began experiencing a major environmental catastrophy, that was and still is destroying the American farming industry. Part of Hoover's 28' campaign was the re-legalization of the SPA party, however, ever since the SPA entered into American political society, the growth of worker strikes (heavily linked to the SPA) and failures of negiotation have seen America's industry slow to a grinding halt. Hoover's policies of actively intervening in the economy and increasing the national debt has brought little success in improving the situtation overall. His victory in 1932 saw little celebrations as it was decided by a House vote, and this has made him quite possibly the most despised man in America. Everyone from Democrats to the ODP, SPA, and AFP are now calling him "The Failed Humanitarian.""
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_2_DESC:0 "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States. With his suprise victory in the 1936 election, he has become the second president in the 20th Century to break the tradtional two terms of the Presidency. Hoover now stands guard over a nation on the brink of another Civil War. Despite all the economic interventionism that Hoover made over the last two terms, it has not done much for the United States. According to some, including his new vice president, it actually made the problem worse. Hoover now acknowledges the dangerous position the country is in and has begun to listen to his advisors such as Vice President Knox, his new cabinet, General Douglas MacArthur, and Director J. Edgar Hoover to help him solve the various economic, societal and political crisises that now plague the United States of America."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_3_DESC:0 "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States, and is the second president in the 20th Century to have three terms in office. Many thought that when Hoover won in 1936, the United States would be forever destroyed, and throughout his term it looked like it was inevitable at various points. However, the important thing to many Americans at the end of the day is that it didn't occur. Hoover has gone from the most liked to the most hated and then back to the most liked politican and president in recent American memory. With the failures of his previous terms long gone, along with many of the problems facing America throughout the 30s, President Hoover and his cabinet look to the future of what this great nation can accomblish with his remaining time in office. These past three terms have aged Hoover to such a degree that the term of adorement used by the public to describe Hoover is "The Grand Old Man.""
POLITICS_FRANK_KNOX_DESC:0 "William Franklin Knox is now the President of the United States. Knox is known for his service to the United States during the Spanish-American War, where he served in the Rough Riders under former President Theodore Roosevelt. Along with his service to the United States, Knox also became quite renowed for owning and operating several newspapers across the Midwest. Frank Knox is now in the most powerful position in America, and as a staunch internationalist and anti-isolationist, he will atempt to prepare the United States for whatever may come next, opposed to what previous administrations have done over the past 30 years."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "Son of Lieutenant general and civil war veteran Arthur MacArthur, young Douglas was prepared from an early life for military service. Instilled with a concern for the common man out west, and a hatred for former Confederates due to harassment in West Point, Douglas became a fine soldier. After serving in the Philippines, diplomatic posts in Japan, and defusing potential war in Mexico, MacArthur became Field Marshall of the Philippine Army. The strategic importance of the Philippines introduced MacArthur to Washington politics, and his set of allies and rivals. Although he adamantly denies being a politician, he has a good relationship with Hoover, conservative Democrats, and William Hearst. Despite his occasional admiration of populist James Coxey, MacArthur is willing to use deadly force against socialists, southern populists, and the forces that perpetuate political gridlock in Washington."

After serving in the Philippines, diplomatic posts in Japan, and defusing potential war in Mexico, MacArthur became Field Marshall of the Philippine Army. The strategic importance of the Philippines introduced MacArthur to Washington politics, and his set of allies and rivals. Although he adamantly denies being a politician, he has a good relationship with Hoover, conservative Democrats, and William Hearst. Despite his occasional admiration of populist James Coxey, MacArthur is willing to use deadly force against socialists, southern populists, and the forces that perpetuate political gridlock in Washington and elsewhere. This is a fact his men have learned and his enemies have learned even more so in recent times, but with the US defeated in the East, now only the Western Command Center remains. MacArthur has fled West and he seems to be a changed man, a new gleam in his eye. His anger and ultranationalism have only increased as a result of his loss in the East and he is now determined to win the war, whatever it takes..."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_D_LEAHY_DESC:0 "William Daniel Leahy, born in 1875 and growing up in the Midwest, may seem out of place in a nation of radicals, revolutionaries, and tyrants. However, as Leahy ambitiously climbed the ranks of the U.S. Navy, he always remained loyal to his country first and foremost. Like his fellow military men, Leahy was troubled by the growing chaos in the United States, and when Douglas MacArthur couped the government, Leahy was silent. As MacArthur began to crack down on both Congress and the U.S. Navy, however, enforcing his will on both groups, Leahy became more and more disenchanted with the American Caesar. When circumstances spiraled out of control, with MacArthur's actions threatening the war effort, Leahy decided it was time to take action. Now, in the aftermath of the navy coup, Leahy leads a fractured government and a broken people in what seems like an unwinnable conflict. Despite this, Leahy has friends, both in Washington and in the West, and his committment to democracy has soothed many who originally felt alienated by MacArthur's leadership. With grim determination and a sharp mind, Leahy will do whatever he must to restore democracy to his battered country."
POLITICS_ERNEST_J_KING_DESC:0 "When Douglas MacArthur took power in Washington, he did not anticipate the danger that an admiral could pose, and yet Admiral Ernest Joseph King has proved to be the cause of MacArthur's demise. King, a brilliant yet arrogant man with a love for the sea and the air alike, has had a remarkable few years. It seemed that his career would be fairly unremarkable until, in the mid-1930's, King was promoted along with many other officers in an effort to help deal with the growing extremist movements in the country. However, King, believing democracy itself to be the cause of the nation's woes, sided with MacArthur when the man came to power. When MacArthur began to lord over the U.S. Navy and worse, King himself, it was a step too far. Believing that MacArthur was neglecting the navy to the detriment of the war effort, and resenting the control of an army man, King led a coup against the government. Now that he runs the country, King has many plans. First and foremost, a significant investment in the U.S. Navy is just what King believes is needed to win the war. When that is done, though, King has further plans for America. Most of all, he wishes to see America take its rightful place in the world, and to do so, he is more than willing to step on potential rivals, especially the scheming remnants of the old Entente..."
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "It's hard to say what the Governor of Louisiana, Huey Long exactly stands for. Some would say that his 'Share Our Wealth' programme is clearly just Syndicalism in new clothing, while others would point at his undemocratic, nepotist style of rule, topped by the usage of the 'Minutemen' paramilitary to harass rivals, as a sign of his National Populist stance. Whatever may be the case, President Long is liked by the common classes, his charisma is exceptional, even if he can get arrogant at times, and his foothold over the south is not to be underestimated."
POLITICS_HUEY_LONGDONG_DESC:0 "Huey Long barely escaped capture when the American Union State fell. Only our quick action was able to save him. Not content to disappear into the dust bin of history, he has now shown up in our capital promising to use his political talent and charisma to keep the Progressive Party in power for a decade or more. He has renounced many of his previous beliefs in favor of a more mainstream Progressive platform, though he insists on keeping his "Share the Wealth" program. His promise is quite alluring and his prowess is obvious, though we must keep a close eye on him..."
POLITICS_FLOYD_OLSON_DESC:0 "Despite his rural upbringing, Floyd Olson has been able to see the great diversity in America through travel and activism.Working as a Shabbos goy, an IWW stevedore, and finally an attorney pushed Olson towards Progressivism in the 1920s. Olson joined up with Robert LaFollete’s Progressive Party following the 1924 election. Olson worked tirelessly for the next decade in order to gain allies for the Progressive Party, stopping only to seek treatment for his stomach ulcers in 1930. A surprisingly influential Governor of Minnesota and a national advocate for peace catapulted him into the White House on a bipartisan ticket against radicalism."
POLITICS_QUENTIN_ROOSEVELT_DESC:0 "The youngest son of former president Theodore Roosevelt, Quentin's early life was groomed for political activism in his father's Republican Party. Quentin, however, wished to be a pilot, and was injured in his training in 1918. Seeing his family and country being torn apart in recent years, Quentin pushed into politics and served as New York's Senator during the fateful year of 1936. Now that the great national disaster is over, Quentin's plan to follow in his father's footsteps and push for a new American Fair Deal."
POLITICS_CHARLES_CURTIS_DESC:0 "As Herbert Hoover's vice president, Charles Curtis is one of the most recognizable faces in America. His protectionism and moderation on social issues would have made him a more than acceptable choice in normal times, but these are not normal times. Regardless, as the times have changed, so too has Charles Curtis, and he has emerged with a plan to address the crises facing the country. Now that he is president, Curtis will attempt to both continue Hoover's legacy and implement "Home Rule Negotiations" in an attempt to solve the political crisis. On the economic front, new tariffs and a work sharing plan are what Curtis believes the country needs to get back on track. His status as the nation's first Native American president and his poor health alike have been largely ignored, with attention instead being placed on his economic plans. The people cry out for help, and if Curtis is unable to address their concerns, the country will suffer greatly. However, if Curtis does succeed in restoring order, he will usher in a new era of prosperity that will redeem the Republican Party and enshrine him as one of America's all-time greatest presidents."
POLITICS_ALF_LANDON_DESC:0 "Alf Landon was a successful entrepreneur in the oil business long before his entry into politics. This self-starter led to the creation of the United States Oil and Gas Association, a lobbying group associated with Standard Oil that Landon remains attached to this day. What initially seemed like a poor decision to break with Hoover's non-intervnetionalist position at the 11th hour before election day turned to his advantage when the Republican Party came with him. Even Hoover has begrudgingly come to endorse Landon, despite this personal betrayal of confidence. Now despite his humble demeanour Landon has proven to be the soft voice of confident economic recovery that America wanted. Although his strong ties with the oil lobby makes him an enemy of both socialists and Longists."
POLITICS_WENDELL_WILLKIE_DESC:0 "Wendell Willkie has been many things in his life before presidency. He began as a William Jennings fan, a populist-minded Democrat. He became a socialist in college, and rumors persist that he seduced Soong Mei Ling during a diplomatic visit to China in 1933. Not to mention an affair with writer Irita Van Doren. He continued to stand out when he opposed Democrats to push for a bank holiday when the Great Depression hit. This support for financial institutions and his assertions that government aid should not interfere with market competition made the difference in his election campaign. There is also his support for integrating the civil service and armed forces, which has put him at odds with many other Democrats. It remains to be seen whether this multitalented man can handle the many roles of the presidency."
POLITICS_HARRY_BYRD_DESC:0 "Whereas many southern populists fell to Huey Long's charms and deserted the Democratic Party, Harry F. Byrd stood his ground. Harry Byrd was born into a Virginian Brahmin family with a direct line to the American Revolution. A firm believer in segregation and fiscally conservative policies intended to reduce the national debt. Holding firm to his anti-Keynesian policies, Harry Byrd won as the stabilizing image of American traditional establishment."
POLITICS_PHILIP_FOLLETTE_DESC:0 "A professional Wisconsin progressive, Philip is the most successful of the politically active La Follette family. A friend and former mentor to Floyd Olson, who had been convinced to join the Farmer Labor Party in order to continue to help his state in need. With the spectre of isolationism that Philip's father Robert stood for, Philip nonetheless stands behind the need for a strong military in the Americas as well as the full extent and strength of the government as promoted by the Farmer Labor Party."
POLITICS_HENRY_WALLLACE_DESC:0 "Humble beginnings as an Iowa farmer did not dissuade a young Henry Wallace from seeing the world and gaining worldly insight. His fortune came from inventing hybrid corn breeds, a major innovation that allowed Wallace him travel the world. Henry visited India and became acquainted with Theosophy, a Hinduist school of thought popular in Russia that draws elements from Christian Anarchism and Socialism. These teachings ultimately alienated him from mainstream socialism and pushed him into the Farmer Labor Party when he returned. Wallace portrays himself above all else a pragmatic economist and an agricultural expert capable of the agrarian reform America needs."
POLITICS_JAMES_MURRAY_DESC:0 "A great controversy surrounded the election of James E. Murray during his election campaign. Tabloids and Republicans all came at Murray claiming that he cannot run for President due to being born in Canada. The truth of these statements may never be known, but his life prior to attending NYU is shrouded in mystery. His life began in earnest when Murray won the Governorship of Montana in 1933. His term as a Democrat was marked by an unusually cooperate relationship with unions and his bold belief that economic reform must disrupt a market if the market is failing."
POLITICS_ALBEN_BARKLEY_DESC:0 "Alben draws from over thirty years of political experience within the Democrat party and his own smart judgement. While Alben supported Wilson's reforms, he opposed McAdoo's attempts to reverse those policies. After several failed national election bids and a steady voting record, Alben was the right piece on the chess board in this election to gain the White House for the Democrats."
POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "The final ascent into the White House by Richard Russell Jr. is the final stroke in a long game that extends even before his time in the Democrat party. Russell Jr. has accumulated the right combination of titles in the US Navy, in the Georgian House of Representatives, and the US Congress to secure universal respect. His focus that de-segregation should happen entirely on southern terms proved popular with a national audience. Time will tell whether this position is sustainable."
POLITICS_GLEN_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Being President was just as much a surprise to Glen Taylor as it was to the voting public. The man that had wanted at one point to be a wandering preacher and then a country singer had finally reached a position that befitted his skills. Taylor was known in Congress as a compassionate economist and advocate of progressive policies and singing to children on the steps of the Capitol. Taylor's compassion fuled his opposition to segregation, and despite his eccentricities he has endeared himself to the American people, which is all he ever wanted."
POLITICS_THOMAS_DEWEY_DESC:0 "Dewey the natural born leader and politician that made it in New York despite his Michigan upbringing. Dewey has continuously proven his assertions correct, including predicting a war in Europe, Asia, and the Americas in the 1930s. His assertions that the New Deal wouldn't be owed entirely to the Republicans was also proven correct. Dewey campaigned under 'Compassionate Capitalism' and tried to distance the reforms from being necessarily welfare. Finally, Dewey's bold prediction that he would win the election came true."
POLITICS_EARL_WARREN_DESC:0 "Young Earl Warren thought his career was doomed when his father Mathias was blacklisted for joining a strike, but instead it motivated the young man into excelling past this stigma. This prior stigma motivated Earl into joining numerous fraternities and lodges in order to intermingle with the people that stigmatized his father, as well as serving in the military. These connections paid off and sent Earl into a life of public service and eventually reached the Governor seat of California in 1932, where he steered the declining Progressive movement towards the political centre away from the even more declining West Coast Socialist Party. Earl became a progressive entryist within the Republican party, pushing for national desegregation."
POLITICS_CHARLES_MCNARY_DESC:0 "Charles McNary stood behind the foundation of the Republican party when it was under attack from all angles in 1936. A Progressive at heart but also a pragmatist, McNary was seen within the party as an insurance against the Northwest descending into radicalism, which also made him allies with an ally of Entente interests in North America. In fact, his company provided electricity to a significant portion of Western Canada by the 1940s due to this relationship."
POLITICS_HARRY_TRUMAN_DESC:0 "Harry Truman's dream of glory in war was dashed when the UC choose to prolong their neutrality during the Weltkrieg. Truman had dropped his college and law degree to prepare himself for the conflict that never came. Continued active service in Central America informed him of the threats of insurgent guerilla warfare. Truman brought this this discipline in the face of chaotic warfare back to Missouri and helped the state as Senator relieve towns that were struck by the chaos of 1936. For this Truman was promoted within the Democratic Party, and supported the New Deal legislation. Most strikingly was his push against the conservatives in favour of military desegregation."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC:0 "Coming from a prominent business family with ties to international trade, William Harriman was able to establish several successful businesses in New York and became an important player in interstate trade. As the federal government has jurisdiction over those transactions, Harriman joined the Department of Commerce. A tactical minded approach to foreign policy and the goal of promoting America's ideology against the radicals that threatened her abroad resonated with Americans and pushed his career upwards."
POLITICS_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "The decision by Strom to turn the Conservative Manifesto into a raison d’état for the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party was a risky move. Strom had spent decades within the Democratic Party attempting to oppose the overreaching powers of the Federal Government, and ensuring that the party never officially endorse desegregation. This gamble has now paid off as Strom Thurmond has been elected President."
POLITICS_HAPPY_CHANDLER_DESC:0 "The turning point in Happy Chandler's career came during his intermission in politics to become the Commissioner of Baseball. A term as Governor had established Chandler as a respectable and industrious Democrat with a firm hand on the party line. This stint as Commissioner of Baseball saw a historical decision to allow integrated baseball teams, which led to the end of segregated baseball. This only further elevated Chandler as a Senator and made his decision to carry this support into the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party even more important. His insistence that fiscal conservatism and the race question were not tied together stood against Strom Thurmond's line..."
POLITICS_JOHN_BRICKER_DESC:0 "An advocate for limited executive power and a non-interventionist interpretation, John Bricker is as old fashioned a Republican as they come. Bricker's career prior to his presidency was that of a rabble raiser and dissenter within the Republican Party railing against suspected socialist sympathizers and opposing the use of executive power to push economic reform. The country as a whole having come close to populist or authoritarian dictatorships just a few years prior."
POLITICS_HAROLD_STASSEN_DESC:0 "While the senior Republican Party leadership like Willkie and Dewey had preoccupied the 1930s with the minutia of the 1936 crisis, Harold Stassen was serving in the US Navy and being exposed into the wider world. An important lesson learned is the importance of international cooperation as opposed to the tariffs that his fellow Republicans were pushing for. A firm opponent of international syndicalism, Stassen believes that laissez faire economic policies must be replaced by strategic economic cooperation There is no need to hold onto undemocratic institutions such as segregation which only feeds syndicalist arguments."
POLITICS_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_DESC:0 "A student of warfare in the famous Class of 1915, Eisenhower's initial enthusiasm for testing new military doctrines vanished in Central America, as generals there failed to win against poorly trained insurgencies. While others in this class fell to either the urge for dictatorship or radicalism. Eisenhower stood firm with the Federal government and tried to stay out of civilian politics. Quoted as saying that he wouldn’t want to any politician, from 'dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe' Four years after he made that statement, Eisenhower was being sworn in as President. This came from a national acceptance for the desegregation of the military Eisenhower oversaw."
POLITICS_ADLAI_STEVENSON_DESC:0 "The reputation of Adlai Stevenson's father, that of an isolationist, dogged Adlai Stevenson II well into his political career. This position among the Democrats was put to the test with the American First Party, which depleted the party rank. Adlai stood to his roots during this most contentious time and persevered. As Governor of Illinois Adlai reformed the police force to be less at odds with socialists and even defended their rights to organize in the face of the Red Scare. Most doubted Adlai's ability to win against the respected General Eisenhower, but through an in kind appreciation from socialist voters Adlai won in the end."
POLITICS_JOHN_SPARKMAN_DESC:0 "Born in a log cabin and raised on a farm, John Sparkman had a very relatable upbringing. A rapidly ascending legal career and political clubs later and Sparkman had become the Democratic Representative for Huntsville. His victory being especially important in the fateful Year of 36 as he beat the AFP's candidate. Sparkman was instrumental in opening education up to immigrants and women in the South. Silent on social matters and bolstered by his support of science education, Sparkman spoke out against defensive US foreign policy, and eventually left for the Constitution Party, where his reputation put him on the fast track to presidency."
#Actually James Eastland not Harry Cain
POLITICS_HARRY_CAIN_DESC:0 "Son of the Mississippi Delta District Attorney, James Eastland was sidetracked from politics for the first three decades in order to run a plantation. An advocate of sharecropping who profited from their work until his plantation quadrupled in size. Eastland stood up in the Senatorial race against the Klan's candidate, and won. Against the Conservative Coalition, Eastman supported the Fair Deal legislation in his home state while voting for it in Congress. As his reputation and passage into the Constitution Party carried much weight, he successfully lead many Democratic voters to his campaign as the closest thing the party could offer to a national candidate."
POLITICS_CULBERT_OLSON_DESC:0 "Culbert Olson had faced both the stigma of running as a Mormon politician, and running as an atheist in his lifetime. In California as Governor, Culbert had to deal with long standing rumors that Mormons had a blood feud with the US Government. Olson's superb term as Governor in passing health care legislation and allowing non-SPA socialists to organize. By the time of the national race, Culbert had come out as an atheist, and faced a second uphill battle. The party stood by him, and ultimately his portfolio allowed him to reach the White House."
POLITICS_EMMETT_ANDERSON_DESC:0 "Hailing from Tacoma, Washington, Emmett T. Anderson was a successful printmaker before politics. During the Crisis of 36, Emmett ensured that presses for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer got out during the strike in Seattle. Emmett also ran his own pamphlets during the crisis decrying the Seattle Democrats as allies of the Silver Legion, and pressed to a peaceful end to the strike. After this the Republican Party got wind, and Emmett was elected to Congress. Eventually his actions were taken up on a national level by Republicans, and became a rallying cry against Democrats that made the difference during the election."
POLITICS_JOHN_GELLATLY_DESC:0 "From bankruptcy in Benton County, Oregon, John Arthur Gellatly distinguished himself as a responsible fiscal conservative. After being elected to Washington State Senate in 1918, Gellatly made several runs for Governor throughout the 1920s and 30s, finally succeeding as Lieutenant Governor during the Crisis of 36. The foundation of the Pacific states required a reliable and uncontroversial Republican candidate, and Gellatly was their man."
POLITICS_HOWARD_HUGES_DESC:0 "Son of an All-American family of ministers and inventors, Howard Hughes broke out of the Midwest by demonstrating a knack for engineering. After the tragic death of his parents, young Howard was thrust into a family fortune and a medical facility in Maryland. Using this vast fortune, Howard created the Summa Tool Corporation, a maker of fine industrial tools. The proceeds were funneled into Howard's Hollywood scripts, including the Academy Award winner 'The World Is Yours'. Expanding finally into Republican politics in California, Howard stood out among a crowd of old money. From RKO to a line of passenger aircraft, Howard was elected under the promise to finish Boulder Dam in Colorado and electrify the states."
POLITICS_FRANK_MERRIAM_DESC:0 "Son of Civil War veterans, Frank Merriam was born in Iowa and planned for a legal career in the Midwest. Upon seeing the rising prominence of the California Republican Party, Frank shifted his career out west. It was Merriam more than anyone that defeated the SPA in California, defeating the Longshoremen strike, and even rebuffing Upton Sinclair when he became the Democrat nominee for Governor. Despite this, traditionally Republican papers resisted Merriam's tax reforms. Upon the ascension of MacArthur, most of these papers were ordered by Hearst to decry all Republicans. Merriam was able to use the public outcry against Hearst and MacArthur to gain the executive seat."
POLITICS_FLETCHER_BOWRON_DESC:0 "A California native and veteran of the Nicaragua War, Fletcher Bowron has a unique relationship with Latin Americans among Republican politicians. The first mayor of Los Angeles to support Cinco De Mayo parades, and an advocate of imprisoning radicals on suspicion. This coupled with Bowron's pursuit of organized crime impressed hardline republicans enough to put him in a greater office."
POLITICS_ROBERT_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Robert Taylor Jones began as a civil engineer out of Tennessee. The most significant project Jones was on was the Panama Canal. The boom of civil constructions out west drew Jones into Arizona, where he entered Democratic politics on a constructive platform. Serving as Governor of Arizona during the Crisis of 36, Jones countered the SPA and AFP candidates who sought to push the state into rebellion. Sadly, rebellion was forced upon the state when MacArthur came, and several democratic politicians betrayed the republic for autocracy. Thankfully Jones had contact with the true loyal Democratic Party, and campaigned for national office."
POLITICS_CLARENCE_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Clarence Martin came into prominence during a consequential Washington State election of 1932, which unseated many Republicans from state office. Clarence may have come in during a major shift, but his credentials in Washington included fostering small business and his unusually respectful discourse. Clarence on principle refused to exaggerate or appeal to populist tendencies in his election campaign, and distinguished himself in the Washington Senate by sponsoring necessary civil works projects. As the Democratic Party was able to wrest the civil works initiative from Republicans across the West, Clarence reaped the benefits politically and received more votes in 36 than Garner in Washington. The desertion of some Democrats to MacArthur only made Clarence's loyalty stand out, and his nomination to the executive chair that more likely."
POLITICS_OSWALD_WEST_DESC:0 "West was luck that the provisional government set up after MacArthur's rise did not specify natural born Americans, as he was born in Canada. Starting out as a Land Agent for Oregon, Oswald West was always diligent with his work. As Governor, West saw passage of Women's Suffrage, Worker Rights, and even state Prohibition, all strengthening the Democratic Party in the state. Taking the initiative to finance a State highway System without Federal money, West successfully pushed public projects. A more fervent advocate of conservative democratic laws on alcohol and even authorizing sterilisation as punishment for breaking morality codes."
POLITICS_CHARLES_SPRAGUE_DESC:0 "A newspaper magnate and business owner, Sprauge got his start in Oregon politics as a newspaper commentator. Reprinted nationally and famed for his advocacy of small business, internationalisation, and fiscal conservatism, many expected him to enter into Democratic politics. Sprauge instead ran as a Republican, and successfully capture democrat voters who supported a fiscally conservative but active Fair Deal. A surprising number of SPA also voted him into Governorship, as he supported their employment programs. This position he encouraged within the Republican Party, and eventually allowed him to gain support throughout the West."
POLITICS_RALPH_CARR_DESC:0 "A follower of Hoover's Republican Party, Ralph Carr's politics in Colorado were fiscally conservative and socially mixed. While Carr did deploy the National Guard to end the Green Mountain Dam Strike of 36, within the PSA Carr refused to imprison radicals. Going so far as to pardon several AFL labor leaders that were arrested without charges. Ultimately a Constitutionalist in a time of crisis where others were stretching legal boundaries. Carr was able to use this as leverage within the Republican Party to secure nomination and ultimately the election."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_LEE_DESC:0 "Joseph Lee was one of the first hard right Utahan Republicans, being elected only shorty after Mormons were allowed into Congress. While others resisted the draft on religious grounds, Lee joined the military and eventually fell on hard times after veterans’ pensions dried up. Running for Governor as a Republican and promising to promote Veteran Pay, Lee had also become acquainted with the old boys’ network of politics. This old boy’s network almost led to his dismissal after he was caught in an illegal gambling den by pro-AFP sheriff W. Skousen. Lee continued to advocate for fiscal conservatism and for admission of all religious right groups into Republican circles, which eventually got him nominated for the highest office."
POLITICS_MONRAD_WALLGREN_DESC:0 "Wallgren's career prior to politics was a combination of business management and pool sharking. A personable and approachable attitude helped jump-start his political career in Washington, especially during the close election of 36. The State Senate saw Wallgren's take an active role in national security, and advocate restricting press of radical elements, Wallgren stood firm as formerly Democratic papers were blacklisted along with SPA and AFP ones after they began supporting MacArthur. Wallgren's opposition eventually forced him out of the Democratic Party while in office, to which he responded by joining the up-and-coming Progressives."
POLITICS_CLYDE_TINGLEY_DESC:0 "Clyde Tingly came to New Mexico to heal his wife's TB, which was worsening in the Ohio weather. Tingly became incensed at the Republican rule in New Mexico, and so began a career in politics and advocacy for health-care reform. A supporter of early Fair Deal proposals, Tingly flew into office on the promise that a new governorship would allow for better usage of state funds. Albuquerque began recovering from the Great Depression under tingly even as most of the nation fell further, and his dedication to health care legislation pushed him into national politics where he became a Progressive."
POLITICS_ARTHUR_LANGLIE_DESC:0 "After a decade on the Seattle City Council. and another four years in the State Senate, Arthur Langlie was one of the youngest nationally recognized politicians in Washington history. Running against and losing to Monrad Wallgren, Langlie recouped and ultimately ingratiated himself into the Republican Party enough to win the nomination. Seen by many as a common man and exemplifier of the immigrant spirit, Langlie answers the Progressive claims to represent immigrant rights."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MCKAY_DESC:0 "Beginning work before he was out of High School, McKay thought his apex would be a used car dealership in Salem, Oregon. Instead, the Republican party encouraged him to run for local and then state offices, eventually being elected to the State Senate in 36. This climactic year saw McKay willingly leave his old supporters behind for the Progressives. An advocate for the national highway system, fiscally moderate Fair Deal policies, and a support for public works has moderated some of the Progressives more radical elements, and helped them take liberal Republican voting districts."
POLITICS_DANIEL_THORNTON_DESC:0 "Active in the 4-H and agrarian rights program, Daniel Thornton moved to Colorado from Texas in order to run a cattle ranch. A brief career in the State Senate combined with his strong personality made his campaign as a Republican to Governorship fairly easy. Known for his Stetson hat, cowboy boots, and smoking pipe, many reports have called Thornton the 'Republican Garner'. The media seemed to place him at odds with Richard Nixon during the election, but their mutual understanding to allow the elder politician to run made the difference at the end."
POLITICS_BOURKE_HICKENLOOPER_DESC:0 "Coming to the West after MacArthur's coup, Bourke initially had very little public support within the provisional government. Partnered with J. William Fullbright, Bourke helped the Republicans whip into shape, and pushed for an isolationist policy towards Canada and Japan. Seen by many as a patriot of a country on the brink of dissolution, Bourke won office by assuring a hard stand against all traitors to the American Republic."
POLITICS_VICTOR_MEYERS_DESC:0 "A multi-talented if not disparate man, Victor Meyers has been called the 'Pagliacci of Politics' in his early days. Back when his political career competed with his musical career. Insisting that the Democrats oppose Prohibition in Washington, he rode aboard a beer wagon during his Gubernatorial campaign. After this failed he began mixing Progressive policies with his natural talent to draw attention to himself. Promising tribes across the West voting rights, advocating pensions, child welfare and unemployment pay, Meyers was at times taken seriously and other times laughed at. A unique proposal for building single-pour concrete housing to solve the homeless issue proved to be both eccentric and effective. Ultimately the Progressives and the American people took him seriously enough to elect him into office."
POLITICS_ANDREW_HOCKENHULL_DESC:0 "A quiet and unassuming politician, Hockenhull rose through the ranks of New Mexican politics through his strong adherence to the Democratic Party line. So, his switch to the Progressive Party in 1928 was a pragmatic switch. Although he did not win the Governorship in 1936, Hockenhull persisted in the public service until the Progressives were forced to run him."
POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "A native Californian and an obstinate quaker, Nixon attempted to join the FBI after college. After failing to do so, Nixon became a lawyer for the major oil companies of California. Nixon began a feud with fellow Republican Earl Warren, which persisted into the national political scene. Nixon took jobs prosecuting politicians in the Pacific States who were suspected of radicalism, and had a good winning record against socialists. Finally Nixon defeated Warren within the Republicans by promising him the Governorship of California in exchange for the National Nomination."
POLITICS_GEORGE_CRAIG_DESC:0 "Born in Brazil, Indiana, and trained to be a lawyer, George Craig was classmates with his eventual electoral rival, William Jenner. Craig would eventually compete with Jenner for the Republican Party nomination after his service during the Crisis of 36. Craig's service constituted defending the American Legion of Clay County against the SPA, which informed his later anti-socialism. As Governor of Indiana, Craig reformed the state government, and refused funds for the national highway in favour of local contractors."
POLITICS_VAL_PETERSON_DESC:0 "A school administrator in Nebraska for the first twenty years of his career, Peterson's introduction into politics came when he entered the US Air Force, and was assigned to trained with Hugh Butler. Butler eventually recommended him to Nebraska Governor Dwight Griswold. Peterson succeeded Griswold as Governor, and worked his way up the Republican Party power structure. Eisenhower recognized a fellow soldier and elevated Peterson within the Party, where he became a nationally recognized politician and presidential candidate."
POLITICS_JOHN_WINANT_DESC:0 "A life filled with difficulty prior to his ascent into office, John Winant's fortunes turned often. From dropping out of Princeton due to inability to pay, to the US Air Service. His military rank had distinguished himself enough to be elected Governor of New Hampshire, while also losing his remaining fortune in the Great Depression. Made Ambassador to Canada, Winant became torn between his duty and an affair with MP Churchill's daughter Sarah. This relationship was broken off, and ultimately his contacts in Canada made his election to the Liberals surer. The chaos of 36 continues to press upon Winant's mind however."
POLITICS_HERBERT_LEHMAN_DESC:0 "As of his inauguration, Herbert Lehman is the first Jewish Head of State in American History. Born into the storied Lehman family, and served in the US Army general staff, Lehman got his start supporting Al Smith's presidential campaign. Lehman served the rest of FDR's term after his death in 1921, and subsequent terms as Governor. Lehman opposed the conservative wing of the Democrats and opposed Eastland while addressing Congress. The Crisis of 36 forced Lehman out of NYC and into the provisional capital of Boston, where his shrewd dealings allowed him to secure safe passage of refugees into New England from the CSA."
POLITICS_PERCIVAL_BAXTER_DESC:0 "A sentry for Maine Republicanism, Percival Baxter has stood against radicalism in his state for decades. Baxter's term as Senator saw a massive expansion to national parks in Maine, and successfully kept the lands free during the Depression. In 1936, Baxter banished several Republicans from the party after uncovering their Klan membership. The rise of MacArthur saw Baxter pushed into New Englander politics, where he represented a return to normal non-radical republican politics."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_KENNEDY_DESC:0 "Born into an Irish Catholic family in Boston, which placed the Kennedy's just out of reach of the political elite. Joseph Kennedy was guided into Harvard to achieve as high a prominence as possible from his birth. Family troubles like the lobotomy of his eldest daughter was pushed aside in favour of dynasty building and business growth. Kennedy owned the largest whiskey importation company in America, and reinvested profits into businesses that sadly fell in the Great Depression. The Crisis of 36 and the reorganisation of New England allowed Kennedy to rally the Democratic voters to his side, becoming the first Catholic Head of State in American history."
POLITICS_CHRISTIAN_HERTER_DESC:0 "Born in Paris, and moving to Boston at a young age, Herter came into wealth via marriage to the Pratt family. Sent to the German Embassy, Herter would frequently recommend America intervene in the Weltkreig to no avail. His return saw him becoming Governor of Massachusetts, and the establishment of essential diplomatic ties with Canada that came into play in 37. Herter continues to advocate America's entry into the Entente, the liberation of democratic France, and the final justice of dismantling the German Empire."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Among the Republican establishment in the Northeast, Joe Martin Jr. had the most sway. Beginning as a newspaper editor of the Boston Evening Chronicle, Martin was elected to the State Senate. Martin fought gerrymandering by the Democrats and eventually joined the Republican National Committee in 1936. Just in time for the nation to collapse. Martin rallied conservative Republicans who opposed Reed and Long's expansion of federal powers and ultimately opposed MacArthur's usurper Democrats. This allowed him to gain the upper hand on New England Democrats and win the snap election."
POLITICS_NORMAN_WALLACE_LERMOND_DESC:0 "A man equally concerned with nature and politics, Norman Wallace Lermond has had a long history with both. From 1880, he became involved in farmers organizations, the Populist Party, and even founded the Socialist Party of Maine in the 1890's. Though his later attempts to start a utopian socialist colony in Washington state were unsuccessful, Lermond came back to New England and built the socialist movement in the region, though it was never directly tied to syndicalism. Instead, Lermond is influenced by Bellamyist ideals, and hopes to bring these ideals to bear in New England. With such a diverse array of influences, Lermond will surely make for a unique leader, but if he wants to keep New England alive, he will have to choose his allies carefully..."
POLITICS_LEONARD_ABBOTT_DESC:0 "Having mixed ties to Britain and America, Leonard Abbott has had a conflicted life. However, when he moved to the United States to be a newspaper editor, he faced discrimination as an anarchist. Seeing the successful revolution in Britain and believing in the possibility of a similar uprising in the states, Abbott aligned himself with other prominent syndicalist thinkers in the Red Belt and elsewhere. However, due to his ties in New England, Abbott decided to stay in the region to attempt to hold an uprising and bring New England into the fold of the Combined Syndicates. Now that he has succeeded in this goal, it is only a matter of time before New England joins its larger western neighbor. May all traitors and reactionaries tremble at the combined forces of these two regions..."
POLITICS_DENNIS_ROBERTS_DESC:0 "A quiet but integral member to the Democratic establishment, his cooperation with the Canadian Liberal party saw his rise through a Canadian sponsored election campaign. This campaign emphasized his loyalty to Rhode Island, his Naval service, and his voting record in favour of civil rights."
POLITICS_PETER_GERRY_DESC:0 "A protégé' of MP Lyon Mackenzie King, great grandson of VP Elbridge Gerry, and inheritor to a vast fortune, Gerry already had a leg up in politics. Becoming the Democratic Whip in the 1920s while a Senator for Rhode Island, Gerry worked his way up the political and social ladder. Marrying into and gaining the support of the Vanderbilt family helped Garry finance bailouts for Rhode Island businesses. MP King convinced Gerry to join the Liberals in 1940 in order to advance their common interest in social liberalism, which eventually paid off in his presidential campaign."
POLITICS_SHERMAN_ADAMS_DESC:0 "A career that spans Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and ultimately the executive chair. Serving as the Republican Speaker of the House in 1940, Sherman pushed through Old Age Pensions laws and worked towards a balanced budget Fair Deal road-map. This ultimately proved popular with Americans after decades of indecisive economic policy, and was used heavily in Sherman's presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ROBERT_BRADFORD_DESC:0 "A Republican in a strongly Democratic Massachusetts, Bradford's combination of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism helped make the case for his term as Governor in 1938. There Bradford successfully prevented strikes from going violent and used public funds to build homes to solve the housing issue. Bradford chaired a Silent Guest program during the turmoil of 36, asking Americans to donate the cost of a meal to the public relief for refugees from Macarthur. This charitable attitude continues into his term in the executive office."
POLITICS_MAURICE_TOBIN_DESC:0 "Tobin's career nearly ended when he was indicted for malpractice that caused the Coconut Grove fire of 1938. Tobin was charged with refusing to allow a club to be closed in order for safety measures to be installed. Tobin learned from this tragic mistake and became a rare Democratic supporter of unions. The union vote helped elevate Tobin within the Democratic Party, where he protected organisation rights, and worked this into a reconciliation position during his national campaign."
POLITICS_PAUL_DEVER_DESC:0 "As a lawyer, Dever made a career in Boston defending business practices of corporations. This all changed when Dever enlisted in the US Army, and served alongside mixed race divisions. As he found out that most of these soldiers were in the Liberal party, Dever entered into politics under the Liberals. An uphill battle against Democrats in Massachusetts commenced that saw Dever promise veteran benefits and welfare extension."
POLITICS_GEORGE_AIKEN_DESC:0 "Aiken, the stalwart Republican and advocate of state-controlled Fair Deal legislation. Aiken in the State Congress passed laws to protect debtors during the Great Depression from losing their all-in debt collection. As Governor, Aiken instituted a pay-as-you go system for road maintenance that worked better than Fair Deal highways in New Hampshire. As a result, Aiken was chosen to run for the party nomination against conservative Republicans."
POLITICS_THOMAS_HART_DESC:0 "An admiral during the inter-war period, Hart had built a reputation of personal bravery and the ability to manoeuvre among politicians stateside. Manoeuvring helped by his marriage of his daughter into the Wilson political family. Ultimately Hart decided to run in national elections as a Democrat, appealing to the impoverished voting base of his native Connecticut."
POLITICS_CHARLES_POLETTI_DESC:0 "Unlike some of his more privileged Republican counterparts at Harvard, Democrat Charles Poletti was not born into one of the leading WASP families of the Northeast. The son of Italian immigrants, Poletti attended college on a scholarship, waiting tables to pay for textbooks. Quickly moving up the ranks of the Democratic party, Polletti's rustic charm enamored him with working-class voters across the country. Now President, Poletti has an ambitious reform agenda of racial integration, expanding welfare, and an aggressive anti-syndicalist international stance. Whether his domestic reforms will earn the support of his more conservative counterparts remains to be seen, however."
POLITICS_NELSON_ROCKEFELLER_DESC:0 "While some pundits are saying the name 'Rockefeller' alone catapulted Nelson to the presidency, Rockefeller's ascendancy to the highest office in the land was no given. Ivy League-educated, and initially working mainly in the business world, the radicalism among other Republican candidates encouraged Nelson to run for the presidency as a check on his more extreme counterparts. Using his family network to seize control of the nomination, Rockefeller's progressive approaches to health-care, welfare, and the economy may be the key to helping unite a divided country."
POLITICS_HENRY_LODGE_JR_DESC:0 "Born into a prominent political dynasty with roots in both New Jersey and Massachusetts, it was no surprise that Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. decided to enter national politics. With a strong family network to rely on, he quickly built a strong power base among the powerful WASP families of the Northeast, catapulting him to the Republican nomination, and now the presidency. More moderate and diplomatic than other Republican candidates, it remains to be seen which direction he will take America in internationally..."
POLITICS_OWEN_BREWSTER_DESC:0 "Hailing from the quiet forests of Maine, Owen Brewster has emerged as a national leader in the anti-syndicalist movement. While initially supporting Huey Long and the AFP in the early 1930's, Long's rejection of the Klan, close allies of Brewster, led to him rejoin the Republican party. Brewster is infamous in Maine, and across the country, for his open courting of the Klan, who were influential in his early gubernatorial and Senate victories. Now President of a divided America, it remains to be seen whether he can reconcile his divisive past with a new view for the future..."
POLITICS_STYLES_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Formerly a teacher, Styles Bridges became the youngest governor in America when he emerged victorious in the 1932 New Hampshire gubernatorial election. Bridges then entered the Senate, earning a name as a ruthless anti-Syndicalist, not above using blackmail, treachery, and deceit to achieve his goals. In one of the most infamous incidents of the early 1930s, launched a major slander campaign in an attempt to label a leading SPA Senator as a 'rampant and notorious homosexual' and a 'traitor to the moral values of our nation'. This sensationalist attack earned him the enmity of Reed and the SPA, but enamored him with those opposed to Syndicalism. Now President, Bridges can turn his attention to stopping Syndicalism around the globe."
POLITICS_HIRAM_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "Born in the mid-century in Sacremento, California, Hiram Johnson came from a political family. Hiram's father, Grove Johnson, was a disgraced state representative, his mother was heavily involved in the Daughters of the American Revolution. Hiram's early political career was boosted by this legacy, and he became a competent DA for San Francisco in 1902. Hiram's gubernatorial race in 1910 was funded by the liberal Republican group 'the Lincoln-Roosevelt League' Johnson's campaign ran in opposition to the Southern Pacific Railroad corporation, who sought to lobby within the Republicans against Hiram. As Governor, Hiram supported anti immigration bills, and paved the way for a later Congressional career. The Republican estabilshment in California was rocked in 1932, when Hiram threw in his support for Herbert Hoover. Hiram's personal distaste for the Eastern Establishment meant he stayed away from the political chaos of 1936."
POLITICS_GEORGE_NORRIS_DESC:0 "George W. Norris was the 11th son of poor Ohioan farmers, yet grew up to accomplish many great deeds, and eventually gain America’s Highest Office. After graduating university, Norris went into practicing law in Nebraska. While in Nebraska Norris became active in the local Republican Party and eventually ran for a seat in the U.S House of Representatives. While a representative, Norris stood with Roosevelt and championed many progressive causes. Eventually becoming a Senator, Norris held little faith to the Party over his ideals, and regularly attacked causes that his own party favoured if it went against his ideals. With America collapsing around him, Norris knew that Hoover could not fix the mess in America, and if America was to be saved, he had to do it without the Republicans. With that, Norris broke from the Republicans and joined with the Progressives, and despite all odds won the Presidency. Now, Norris will have the tremendous responsibility of holding America together and guiding her to a brighter future. "
POLITICS_IRENEE_DU_PONT:0 "Irénée du Pont, descended from the influential du Pont Family was primed for being an influential figure in the region of New England, yet the type of influence he would exert never became clear until America fell apart at the seems. From 1919 to 1925 he was the president of the Du Pont chemical company, he resigned his position after eight workers were poisoned, something to which he responded with "Only slight difficulties have been encountered". Du Pont eventually joined with the “Sentinels of the Republic”, a group that started as a lobbying form against government intervention and socialism yet transformed into a militant group influenced by Alfred Sloan’s ideas of unrestrained capitalism. When the Federalists gained control of New England, the Sentinels and the Remnants acted against the government, eventually storming congress and forming a new government, one headed by Du Pont.

POLITICS_LOTHROP_STODDARD_DESC:0 "Lothrop Stoddard began his life in Massachusetts, and from an early age, he displayed an exceptional intellect. When he was old enough, Stoddad attented Harvard University, earning the 'magna cum laude' distinction and working towards a Ph.D. in History. After he achieved this, he joined several historical and political organizations and began his work as an author, espousing eugenicist and racialist views to explain what he sees as the current decline of civilization. Despite his background in history and political science, Stoddard is a great admirer of biology. He believes it is the key to explaining the relationship between the different human races as well as being the causal factor in the United States's current woes. As such, his writings are characterized by both political and scientific views, mostly on the topics of race and genetic superiority. Stoddard's popularity as an author greatly aided his efforts in joining the political arena, and though he is seen as occupying the political fringe, his work is familiar in almost every home in New England. Now that he is in charge of the country, Stoddard has power he never expected to possess, and he plans to use it to save human civilization itself."
POLITICS_JOHN_MCGROARTY_DESC:0 "Born at Buck Mountain, Pennsylvania during the Fall of 1862 as the youngest of 12 Children, McGroarty was never assumed to be anyone of importance, but fate works in mysterious ways. McGorarty began a career in Law before beginning a career as an executive in a Montanan Mining Company before moving once again to Los Angeles to become a Journalist. After becoming famed for his introspective writing on Lincoln and the black community, McGroarty began authoring everything from books to plays to dramas until being elected to Congress in the 1930s for the Democratic Party. McGroarty would run for President in 1936 to only fail miserably in the nominations, due to Garner and with his failure to become his Vice Presidential nominee, McGroarty would decide to quit politics and return to Journalism in California. Before McGroarty could settle down however, the 2nd American Civil War kicked off and he decided to once again get back into politics. Running with the Democratic Party again, McGroarty was able to sweep the nominations and be elected to the highest office in all the land. Though McGroarty has campaigned on a promise of Hope and Unity, it is unknown whether he can deliver on those promises."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_RANDOLPH_HEARST_DESC:0 "The influence that William Randolph Hearst holds over America can not be understated. He is the head of one of America’s largest newspapers and can change public opinion on his own whims. His tactics of sensationalism and “Yellow Journalism” have put him in the center of the publishing industry and has gained him many political points. Indeed, his influence extends deep into politics as well, enough to earn him the presidency of the Pacific States. Originally, he sided with Progressive ideals, but eventually drifted right, now as President his National Democratic Party has instituted authoritarian and right-wing measures, and many fear that Hearst is close to becoming a dictator. "
POLITICS_EDWARD_LONGSTREET_BODIN_DESC:0 "Edward Longstreet Bodin is a mysterious man, but as the leader of the Spiritualist Movement, some would argue he has to be. His birth in 1894 came, in his view, as the culmination of a family history originating in the sixteenth century French demonologist Jean Bodin. The younger Bodin has always shown a fascination with such subjects, as well as the paranormal and extraterrestrial. His ideas have manifested themselves in his "Spiritualist Party" which, while on the fringe of American politics, has attracted a passionate following. Bodin has taken advantage of the recent state of chaos in America to elbow his way into the political arena, stepping on many but meeting a curious ally along the way. L. Ron Hubbard has become a sort of right-hand-man to Bodin, and with the help of Japanese sympathizers, the two men hope to exorcise the twin demons of Syndicalism and Anglo-Monarchism in America and soon, the world. Bodin will have to take care, though: the diverse factions he has so adeptly unified into one party could just as quickly dissolve into infighting not unlike the kind seen on the national stage."
POLITICS_L_RON_HUBBARD_DESC:0 "To some, Hubbard is a messiah, to others he is a madman, but regardless Hubbard is one thing: powerful. Hubbard came from humble beginnings, eventually finding work publishing for pulp fiction magazines, where he wrote many genres, mainly science fiction. After a near-death experience he published “Excalibur”, which originally failed to gain any mainstream popularity. However, during the chaos of the Spiritualist Coup Hubbard took a place right by the side of Edward Longstreet Bodin, a man who shared many of his radical beliefs. Hubbard’s influence grew within the part until he eventually gained the highest level of leadership in the land when Ed Bodin was killed by a crazed Syndicalist gunman. Many still think that Hubbard organized his killing, but that matters little now. Hubbard is in charge and will guide the human race to a higher plane of existence. "
## United Kingdom ##
POLITICS_EDWARD_BRITAIN_DESC:0 "Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_UK_DESC:0 "Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg, has led a coup against the government of the Union of Britain. Rumors abounded that Lawrence harboured monarchist sentiments. and indeed, such speculation proved correct. Lawrence proclaimed the re-establishment of the United Kingdom, and invited the Windsors to return to Britain."

POLITICS_ARTHUR_HORNER_DESC:0 "Born in the mining town of Merthyr Tydfil in Southern Wales, the young Arthur Horner was very much a working-class lad. As the eldest surviving son of seventeen children, of whom only six lived past infancy, his career began in the mines of Wales, and the idealistic young man came into contact with the mining unions of Southern Wales, becoming a member.\nHe would continue his low-level political activism in Welsh mining unions until the British Revolution of 1925, when the Monarchy was forced out and the Union of Britain was declared by the Trade Union Congress.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Horner was a key organiser of Miner's strikes in Wales and played a large role in guaranteeing the support of Miner's unions of Wales. After the death of the revolutionary leader John Maclean, Horner became involved in the emerging factionalism of the TUC, becoming an important leader of the status quo Federationist faction, favouring the Unions and the status quo established after the 1925 revolution.\n\nHorner's big moment came when Philip Snowden retired from the position of General Secretary of the TUC, and Horner captured and canvassed enough votes to become the new General Secretary of what is the vanguard of Syndicalism in Europe. Socialist Britain stands united under its General Secretary, for better and worse times to come!"
POLITICS_PHILIP_SNOWDEN_DESC:0 "The mild-mannered Viscount almost shouldn't have been the Chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, yet somehow he is, and he is well liked by the factions of what is a viciously factional body. Snowden's victory is largely credited to his decision to avoid the fractional politics of the Trade Union Congress and how he showed himself to be an unaligned and neutral candidate, free of partiality. Since his assuming of the title of Chairman, Snowden has seen old faces go and new faces come in the TUC, but he has always remained a symbol of British post-revolutionary unity, always calming factional tensions wherever they come, and seeking to maintain a balance between all four factions- which is perhaps why he unopposed Mosley's bid for Exchequer. The former Liberal-turned-Syndicalist is perhaps the most normal figure in these strange times, always staying above and refusing to occupy his time with petty insults. As the 1936 Congress of Trade Unions approaches, Snowden has given many hints to his possible retirement- an uncomfortable reality to say the least."
POLITICS_TRADE_UNION_CONGRESS_DESC:0 "Until the next year, the Trade Union Congress will have to work without a Chairman."
POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralisation, and aggressive foreign policy."
POLITICS_NICLAS_GLAIS_DESC:0 "Niclas Y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural laborers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem "The Red Flag" is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."
POLITICS_ANNIE_KENNEY_DESC:0 "Annie Kenney, imprisoned by the old regime of Britain for militant women's suffrage activism, convinced many of the working women of Britain to join the Trade Union movement in the prelude to the British Revolution. Her advocacy massively inflated support for the revolution, and subsequently pressured the new socialist government to grant political rights to women.\n\nOriginally run as candidate for TUC chair by the pacifist Congregationist faction in protest of the TUC's alleged failure to secure equality between men and women, through cooperation with the more orthodox Federationist faction, Kenney has become the first chairwoman of the TUC."
POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following electoral gridlock. Mann, though a Leninist, has shown great historical commitment to the Trade Union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service. Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."
POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg, has led a coup against the government of the Union of Britain. Lawrence, charismatic yet reserved, has made ambiguous promises to the British people regarding Britain's future. While his past dedication to the Syndicalist cause is undeniable, many speculate that he harbours monarchist sympathies."
POLITICS_CLEM_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Clem Attlee, shocked and disgusted by the poverty he witnessed while working at youth charity, became a prominent figure within the Independent Labour Party, and eventually the Trade Union movement. His activism, however, was cut short by the Weltkrieg.\nAttlee served on multiple fronts during war, and was eventually promoted to the rank of major. While Attlee's army service did instill in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."
POLITICS_BARBARA_CASTLE_DESC:0 "Barbara Castle, as a girl of only fifteen, led the children of her secondary girls' school in a rising in support of the British Revolution. The quirky red-haired girl quickly became a cultural icon throughout the newly established Union of Britain.\nAs she grew into a young woman, Castle again came into the public eye as the first female leader of the Oxford Students' Union, and never again left it. She became an increasingly vocal Congregationist, and eventually challenged the leadership of the admittedly magnanimous Annie Kenney.\n\nAs chairwoman of the TUC, Castle has vowed to fight the injustices that still plague the Union of Britain, especially inequities between men and women."
POLITICS_ERIC_BLAIR_DESC:0 "Eric Blair, the famous writer who helped propel his long-time ally Oswald Mosley to political prominence, came gradually to oppose Mosley. At every opportunity, Mosley seemed to tread upon the principles of the Union of Britain and the revolution which created it.\n\nBlair, with political triumph over his old friend, has vowed to restore to the people of Britain the freedoms Mosley so egregiously stripped from them."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_GALLACHER_DESC:0 "William Gallacher founded the Labour Withholding Committee in opposition to the Weltkrieg era Munitions Act. Jailed in his native Glasgow for undermining the war effort, Gallacher became increasingly radicalised. Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nGallacher, though initially opposed to Niclas y Glais's devolution efforts, has become satisfied with the current state of affairs."

POLITICS_URG_CNA_DESC:0 "With the 1917 constitutional referendum and a constituent assembly in 1918, a new constitution was enacted in 1919 by President Baltasar Brum, which stated that the executive power has to be shared between the President of the Republic and the 'Consejo Nacional de Administracion' ('National administration Council'). The council is made by nine members that are elected every six years, which generally are six from the ruling party and three from the opposition. The role of the president belongs to the council candidate with the most votes, but he can be only responsible for Foreign Affairs, National Security and Agriculture, whereas the NCA is responsible for the rest of the executive branch responsibilities."
POLITICS_GABRIEL_TERRA_DESC:0 "José Luis Gabriel Terra was born in 1873, in Montevideo. He graduated as a lawyer in 1895, where he later became a minister for President Claudio Willman, where he proved great expertise in economic and diplomatic affairs. Later on, he became one of the members of the Constituent Assembly in 1917 and was a minister during Baltasar Brum's rule. He is affiliated to the Partido Colorado, although he has proven to have opposing views with the leader of the party, Jose Battle Ordóñez. He's a known conservative and authoritarian, and now that he rules Uruguay, he'll try to centralize his power, balance the state's budget and avoid liberal and progressive reforms."
POLITICS_ALFREDO_FERRARI_DESC:0 "Alfredo Baldomir Ferrari was born in 1884, in the small town of Paysandú. He graduated from the Military academy in 1905, and later on he studied to become an architect, alternating between his two careers until reaching the rank of general in 1935. Now he's been named military governor of Uruguay, and while he has shown leniency towards his rebellious citizens, he still has to maintain order in the country, and will suppress any group that might dare disturb it."
POLITICS_EMILIO_FRUGONI_DESC:0 "Emilio Frugoni Queirolo was born in 1880, in Montevideo. He was already a political activist when he was in highschool, and took part in the 1904 civil war defending the government of José Battle y Ordoñez. When the war was over, he formed the 'Centro Obrero Socialista' which would start the process of creating the 'Partido Socialista de Uruguay' in 1910, with Frugoni as its general secretary. He became deputy for that party in 1916 and 1920, however, with the fall of Britain and France to syndicalism, many of his party became to radicalize, turning his party into the 'Partido Sindicalista de Uruguay', whose advocation of violence forced Frugoni to leave the party he created, and has since then been rebuilding the Uruguayan Socialist Party.\n\nIn his words, 'Socialism is not violence, nor dispossession, nor redistribution', and now that he is in power, he shall respect the Uruguayan constitution and political system while at the same time trying to peacefully lead it to the revolutionary ideals he champions."
POLITICS_PAULINA_LUISI_DESC:0 "Paulina Luisi Janicki was born in 1875, in Colón, Entre Rios Province, Argentina. Born to an Italian father and polish mother, they moved shortly after to Paysandú and then finally settled in Montevideo in 1887. She became the first Uruguayan woman to study medicine when she began her career in the 'Universidad de la Republica' in 1900, where she graduated as a physician in 1908.\n\nShe afiliated the Partido Socialista de Uruguay when it was founded in 1910, where she found the place to fight for cultural and civil rights for women in a political platform, and then went on to create the 'Consejo Nacional de la Mujer Uruguaya' and the 'Alianza Uruguaya de Mujeres' in 1919. She later went on to France to specialize in Dermatology and venereal diseases. She then witnessed the events of the French Syndicalist revolution herself, which inspired her to take those ideals back to Uruguay. Now that she is in power, she plans to follow the example of her European Comrades."
POLITICS_JUAQIN_ILLA_DESC:0 "Joaquin Secco Illa was born in 1879, in Montevideo. He graduated the 'Universidad de la Republica' as a Lawyer and was designated professor of civil rights of that university in 1906. He formed the 'Union Civica del Uruguay' in 1912 as a christian democrat party, but rejoined with the 'Blanco Party' later on. A known conservative and Christian, now that he sits in the Palacio Estevez, he shall lead Uruguay prioritizing christian values and stability over progress."
POLITICS_LUIS_ALBERTO_DE_HERRERA_DESC:0 "Luis Alberto de Herrera y Quevedo was born in 1873, in Montevideo. He graduated with a doctorate in Law and Social sciences from the 'Universidad de la Republica'. He participated in the 1897 revolution by the Partido Blanco in and left for the US in 1901, where he served as ambassador for Uruguay. In 1920 he was chosen as director of the Partido Nacional and was the president of the CNA from 1925 to 1927.\n\nWhile his reputation is far from perfect, with multiple conflicts with more radical and progressive factions within the PN, he has proven in the past that he has a genuine concern for the well-being of the Uruguayan citizens and workers. Now that he leads Uruguay, he shall focus on reducing government intervention on the economy, improving the agrarian economy instead of industrializing Uruguay and, inspired by Alexis de Tocqueville's writings, increase the local autonomy of each city and town within Uruguay."
POLITICS_LUIZ_CONRADO_BATLLE_BERRES_DESC:0 "Luis Conrado Battle Berres was born in 1897, in Montevideo. He became an orphan when he was eleven, and went to live with his uncle, Jose Battle y Ordoñez. While he was living with his uncle, Jose managed to become president of Uruguay, and inspired Luis to sign up in the 'Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de la Republica', where he graduated as a lawyer and joined the Partido Colorado, and thanks to his uncle's connections, has remained a popular choice in the party as a deputy, and now even managing to become a presidential candidate.\n\nDespite his young age and inexperience, the legacy of his uncle, which many regard with having transformed Uruguay into the 'Switzerland of South America', is still alive in the memory of many Uruguayans. As his uncle, he'll champion the ideals of his new 'Batllismo', an interventionist state which shall guarantee social plans for the poor and progressive reforms for the disenfranchised."
POLITICS_JUAN_DE_AMEZAGA_DESC:0 "Juan Jose de Amézaga Landaraso was born in 1881, in Montevideo. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad de la Republica' in 1905, and traveled for a year and half between Germany and France. His experience in Europe brought him closer to the ideals of Batllismo, and joined up the Colorado Party as soon as he had returned. He became a deputy for the town of Durazno in 1908 with only twenty-seven years, receiving praise and support from Jose Battle y Ordoñez himself. He has since then climbed through the ranks and now that he sits in the Palacio Estévez, he's bound to continue the old Batllist policies."

To this end, he now seeks to establish control over the Yemeni hinterland, establish a modern standing army, and establishing clear rules for succession of hereditary governorships, all while keeping a close eye on the tumultuous political environment in Sana'a itself. With al-Hamid at the helm, Yemen moves into the modern age while maintaining its semi-feudal state of affairs."

As a Sunni, he took up rebellion against Imam Yahya in 1928 when the Imam has imposed his rule over Aden. Al Nasser then fled the Imam's draft, and joined the rebels. The rebellion saw Ali Nasser tap into his artistic side, waxing poetic about his mission to kill the Imam. To this end, he joined the underground Hait al-Nadial organisation, and through his expressive voice became their leader."
POLITICS_SHABAB_AL-AMR_DESC:0 "Out of Ta'izz, the Numan family could be described as middle class. As a Sunni, Ahmad could not attain a proper education in Muslim science to advance in Yemen. This may have been due to rumors that his family was descended from Yemeni Jews. Instead, Ahmad was educated in western logic at the al Madrassa al Ahliyya. This school eventually played host to Ahmad's reform group Nadi a Islah. The Nadi a Islah saw both the Mutawakkili kingdom and the Ottoman Caliphate as relics that held back Yemen. He formed a program that disguised social reforms behind the terminology of reactionaries. Promoting the Good and Preventing the Bad was allowed his rebellion to sway otherwise conservatives Yemenis. Ultimately, this proclamation for Yemen was to ease change into a country badly divided."
