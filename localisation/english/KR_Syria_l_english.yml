### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ANTOUN_SADEH_DESC:0 "Born in the Beirut Vilayet, Antoun Saadeh is a man of many talents and little patience. After living half of his life abroad in the west, Antoun returned to his homeland in 1925 to find the dream of democratic Lebanon dead. In Lebanons's rubble, Antoun founded an organisation called Natural Syria, dedicated to a non-sectarian independent Syria that could stand against Ottoman and Western Imperialism. Sharing only a distaste for imperialism, Antoun rejected the message of the syndicalists as divisive and rejected the Ba'ath ideals. Antoun sees Natural Syria as the homeland of ally Syrians, Kurds, Iraqis and Lebanese regardless of race. In his writing, Antoun claims that he will merge the best parts of socialism, nationalism, and patriotism under the Zawbaa."
POLITICS_FAWZI_QUWU_DESC:0 "Captain of the 12th Ottoman corps of Mosul, Fawzi had proven his bravery to the Turks. Where many heard the call of Faisal's Arab Revolt, Fawzi heard only the commendations from General Otto von Kreiss. When the Turks were victorious, they made Fawzi a Pasha. Although showered with praise, Fawzi refused to call himself a Pasha. His current role as military governor is unique among the vilayets as he exerts considerable control over the soldiers in his command."
POLITICS_ADIB_BIN_HASSAN_SYR_DESC:0 "Sami Al Hinawi has spent his career avoiding the easy paths to power. Never renouncing his Arab name in the Ottoman Military, his loyalty earned him the right to use his birth name. The allure of the Arab Revolt never reached him in during his time in the Jerusalem Vilyet. A possible alliance between his officers and the emerging SSNP was rejected on the same basis that the easy way to power is a trap. Time will tell whether this stalwart commitment will pay off."
POLITICS_SHUKRI_QUWATILI_DESC:0 "Among the several branches of Al Fatat in the Arab world, none would be as successful as Syria's. This is due to the careful manoeuvring of their leader, Shukri al-Quwatli. Despite his exile from Syria twice, he has again returned and collects his allies in preparation for a new type of Republican government. Shukri's position in Syria is an intermediary between the liberal burghers and conservative landowners that hold judicial power in Syria."
POLITICS_SULTAN_ATRASH_DESC:0 "Sultan Atrash is relied upon by the Syrian people not because he is a great unifier. Atrash openly admits that he seeks autonomy for his Druze people against the wishes of his own allies. This push for autonomy of Syria's minority groups is however unilateral. Atrash wishes to rebuke pan arabism and protect Syria as a nation of minorities."
POLITICS_NAZIK_AL_ABID_DESC:0 "Once exiled to Cairo in the wake of a Turkish crackdown, Nazik al Abid has pulled off an incredible achievement other Arab feminists like Tarab Abdul Hadi could only dream of; for she was elected head of state of Syria. Her work establishing the International Red Crescent and her liberal position towards veils has finally paid in dividends for her and for women across Syria, as her notoriety has put her in a prime position to lobby for their rights in the country."
POLITICS_SABRI_ASALI_DESC:0 "Sabri al-Asali began as an Arab member of the Ottoman Parliament in the capital. Where many of this contemporaries joined secret societies and stocked weapons, Al Asali knew that legislation would lead to Syria's freedom. When the pen signed Syria's independence, he was in Cairo in Hal'il meeting with heads of state. It is through the outside in that Sabri al-Asali assumed power in Syria. He may be out of touch with the common Syrian, but his commitment to economic ties with the Arab world set Sabri apart from his peers."
POLITICS_MICHEAL_AFLAQ_DESC:0 "Michel Aflaq was in Paris during the Syndicalist revolution. Swept up in the socialist organisations, he joined the Commune's government as an informal student. There he studied trade unionism with Saladin al Bitar, and they both decided that Syria was ready for revolution in 1925. The revolution to be, a renaissance or Ba'ath, never materialised. Michel was unable to form trade unions in Damascus or Mosul, so he returned to Paris in 1930 abandoning the Ba'ath party. His return as of late as an emancipator and the forced creation of a trade union council in Damascus means his power is backed up by his superiors in the Internationale more than it is backed by Syrian supporters. This will not stop Aflaq from realizing the dream of Ba'ath however, a united Syrian proletariat."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A Sheikh is not the first person the International expected when they asked Syria to elect their first leader among the syndicates. While it is true that Muhammad al-Ashmar's first station was a Mufti, he is now a leader of the people. His influence within the mosques in reinterpreting Islamic law and rejecting Secular syndicalism in favour of voluntary Zakat from all sets him apart from any other branch of socialism in Syria."
