### Events ###
ott.1.t:0 "The Sublime State"
ott.1.d:0 "Once the greatest empire in existence, spanning three continents and ruling over millions of people the Ottoman Empire had declined by the late 19th century, to the point of being known as the 'sick man of Europe'. An inability to industrialise, the nonexistence of an educated middle-class, and a chronic lack of funds meant that the Ottoman State had dropped back well behind the European powers by 1876, when Abdülhamid II took the throne.\n\nAt the time, the Ottoman army was still reeling from the shock of the Russo-Turkish war of 1877, the Ottoman treasury had just declared bankruptcy and several interest groups were scheming to obtain political control of the Empire. These weaknesses led the Empire to seek closer cooperation with European powers.\n\nPrussian military successes against France led the Empire to form military and economic ties with the Germans, culminating in the construction of the Berlin-Baghdad railway in 1888.\n\nDuring his reign Abdülhamid II launched massive education programs and made desperate diplomatic manoeuvres to keep his Empire intact; while at the same time he engaged in systematic repression of opposition groups in an effort to maintain his absolute rule.\n\nDespite these efforts, a revolt of the 'Young Turks' in 1908, the subsequent dethronement of Abdülhamid II in 1909, and a bloody coup in 1913 meant that in the days leading up to the Weltkrieg, the Ottoman Empire was ruled by a triumvirate of 'Three Pashas'; Enver, Talat and Cemal.\n\nIn 1914, as the Weltkrieg began in Europe, the Young Turk government signed a secret treaty with the Germans and soon after joined the war against the Entente powers..."
ott.1.a:0 "God save the Empire..."

ott.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Ottoman Empire!"
ott.2.d:0 "Almost a month ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing the economy of the German Empire into an unprecedented crisis. Now the shock waves of the crash have reached the Ottoman Empire. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ottoman lira is losing it's already-low value, and resource exports are shrinking. Our unstable economy is on the verge of collapse..."
ott.2.a:0 "Great Allah protect us!"

ott.3.t:0 "Initial Stabilisation"
ott.3.d:0 "With the first wave of the crisis slowly passing by, some less affected branches of the economy have bounced back from the bottom. Still, the overall state of our economy does not look optimistic..."
ott.3.a:0 "Let's hope stabilisation will come soon..."

ott.4.t:0 "Government Intervention"
ott.4.d:0 "With at least partial political stabilisation finally in place, we are prepared to enact a series of intensive reforms, aimed at restoring pre-crisis industrial power."
ott.4.a:0 "Excellent!"

ott.5.t:0 "Further Stabilisation"
ott.5.d:0 "Thanks to renewed interest of foreign companies, our economy continues to regain pre-crisis efficiency."
ott.5.a:0 "Keep it up!"

ott.6.t:0 "Request of the International Jewish Lobby"
ott.6.d:0 "The Ottoman authorities have always welcomed the Jews. Since the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, who allowed the settlement of the Iberian Jews in his lands after their expulsion from Spain, they have been an integral part of the empire. However, since the rise of Zionism, laws have been passed to prevent the mass-settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine, while avoiding restriction on their pilgrimages. Recently we have been approached by members of the international Jewish lobby, asking for less constricting laws."
ott.6.a:0 "Very well, allow limited settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine."
ott.6.b:0 "Grant complete freedom of settlement to all non-Ottoman Jews."
ott.6.c:0 "We will not jeopardise the stability of Palestine!"

ott.7.t:0 "Settlers in Palestine"
ott.7.d:0 "The incredible number of Jews who flocked towards Palestine after the passage of new Settlement Laws caused a drastic demographic change in the region. Since their settlement in Jerusalem and the environs, it has become clear that Hebrew is rapidly becoming the second, and some might even argue first language of Palestine. The ideals of Zionism have also entered our lands, and several Judaic factions have already requested increasing amounts of autonomy, even verging on demands for independence."
ott.7.a:0 "Our greatness came from centralised government, we are not giving away power!"
ott.7.b:0 "Grant them local autonomy."

ott.8.t:0 "The Great Arab Revolt!"
ott.8.d:0 "In the middle of [GetYear], faced with mounting oppression from their Turkish masters, several Arab cities erupted in open revolt. Mobs began burning down Ottoman institutions and raided police and military bases. From Baghdad to Jerusalem, Arabs have risen up against the Ottoman Empire."
ott.8.a:0 "We will crush them!"

ott.9.t:0 "Ottoman Empire calls for aid!"
ott.9.d:0 "Faced by an invasion from all sides, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire has come to us in an effort to secure weapons for his dangerously under-equipped army. While we ourselves are preparing ourselves for war as well, sending over some equipement could earn us their trust and maybe even access to the valuable black gold of the desert."
ott.9.a:0 "Give them our full support."
ott.9.b:0 "Give them our full support."
ott.9.c:0 "We'll send them what we can spare."
ott.9.e:0 "We have far more important matters to attend to."

ott.901.t:0 "[From.GetName] sends support!"
ott.901.d:0 "Convinced by our plea for support, [From.GetName] has decided to accept our call and send us the weapons we desperately need. Whether it is out of opportunism or in an effort to support old friends is unclear but we're happy nonetheless."

ott.12.a:0 "Oh shid you caught me :DDDD."

ott.13.t:0 "Status Quo Antebellum"
ott.13.d:0 "After narrowly escaping defeat and destruction in the Weltkrieg, the Ottomans found that they had lost much for little gain. Suffering through 12 years of war, disease and poverty, the Ottoman Empire had gained nothing to show for it.\n\nFollowing the gloomy conclusion of the disastrous war, Enver, Talat and Cemal Pashas attempted to reinforce their authority, but the Committee of Union and Progress government had lost all credibility by then. Added to this was the immense pressure from various groups to prosecute the Young Turks responsible for dragging the Empire into war. This quickly led to the downfall of the triumvirate, who escaped abroad.\n\nWith German support the Ottoman Sultan had regained a semblance of authority, albeit weak. Unfortunately the Germans had an interest in maintaining the status quo and so consistently backed the monarchy in any clashes with opposition groups, while at the same time letting Sultan Mehmed VI know that non-compliance on his part would lead to a withdrawal of their support.\n\nIn 1936 then the Empire is staggering and slipping. More and more groups demanding reforms are appearing, to be joined by various nationalist groups intent on achieving independence. Economically too it is reliant on German support, especially the oil trade from the Middle East. In other words the Ottoman Empire is now regarded as the 'terminally ill man of Europe'."
ott.13.a:0 "Calm before the storm..."

ott.14.t:0 "Our Lands Expand"
ott.14.d:0 "Following years of contention involving domestic Arab nationalists, the Ottoman Empire has released several of its provinces to our control."
ott.14.a:0 "Good for them!"

ott.15.t:0 "Nawruz Day Riots"
ott.15.d:0 "Dissatisfaction in the Kurdish parts of our empire has reached a boiling point, with many demanding greater autonomy and some going as far as to demand outright independence. March 21st is an important date for these separatists, as it marks the day of traditional spring festivities and the Persian New Year. During this year's Nawruz celebrations, a seemingly small incident in Diyarbakır quickly got out of hand and turned into large-scale revolt. Protests and riots are erupting across our Kurdish provinces, and while we have reason to suspect the Syndicalists are behind it all, many Kurdish landowners and tribes have declared their support for the movement as well."
ott.15.a:0 "This does not look good..."

ott.16.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising"
ott.16.d:0 "As the Ottoman Gendarmerie failed to defuse the situation, Kurdish riots grew day by day. The rebellious Kurdish subjects of the Sultan had grown tired of the repression and lack of autonomy. Open uprisings were reported in all Kurdish majority areas of the Empire. Could this be the final blow to Sick Man of Europe?"
ott.16.a:0 "We'll see..."

ott.17.t:0 "Report from the East"
ott.17.d:0 "With regions inhabited by Kurds in open rebellion, the stability of the Ottoman Empire is on the verge of collapse since one successful uprising can cause a Domino effect in our Arab provinces and subject states. We must crush this uprising quickly."
ott.17.a:0 "Crush the enemies of the Devlet-i Aliye!"
ott.17.b:0 "Perhaps they deserve independence..."

ott.18.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising Crushed!"
ott.18.d:0 "Our military has successfully taken control of all Kurdish national territory. Once again their uprising was futile."
ott.18.a:0 "These Kurds will never learn from the past!"

ott.19.t:0 "Kurdistan Remains Defiant!"
ott.19.d:0 "Even the concentration of our elite armed forces has been unsuccessful in breaking apart the rebellious state of Kurdistan. Some members of the general staff suggest that continuing with this fruitless effort greatly weakens our forces facing the hostile Arab states of the peninsula as well as Egypt. Perhaps we should recognise the independence of Kurdistan?"
ott.19.a:0 "Accept their independence..."
ott.19.b:0 "Never!"

ott.20.t:0 "Kurds Join The Uprising"
ott.20.d:0 "The eruption of the Kurdish uprising in the Ottoman Empire convinced part of our Kurdish population to leave the country to join the fighting. Shall we allow them to leave our country to join the uprising?"
ott.20.a:0 "Well, who cares?"
ott.20.b:0 "Prevent them from leaving."

ott.21.t:0 "Volunteers From Persia"
ott.21.d:0 "Our fight for the freedom of the Kurdish nation has attracted the attention of all Kurds. Many have decided to leave their homelands to join our fight for freedom!"
ott.21.a:0 "We need all the help we can get!"

ott.22.t:0 "The Future of Kurdistan"
ott.22.d:0 "After the bloody liberation war against the Ottomans it is now time to decide the fate of Kurdistan. Shall we introduce democracy based on the people's will to Kurdistan, or do we need the stability offered by a monarch to lead us to prosperity?"
ott.22.a:0 "Introduce democracy to Kurdistan!"
ott.22.b:0 "A Kurdish King shall bring stability!"

ott.23.t:0 "General Elections in Kurdistan!"
ott.23.d:0 "Since the beginning of the struggle for freedom many different parties have claimed that they are the one true ruler of Kurdistan. Four big parties have a chance of winning, Partiya Sosyalisti, a radical socialistic party. The second party is the Partiya Demokrate Kurdistan, a social conservative party. The third option is the Partiya Azadi, a social democratic party! The last choice is the radical Partiya Serbokho, a nationalist party."
ott.23.a:0 "Solidarity, Brotherhood and Freedom! Partiya Sosyalisti."
ott.23.b:0 "Democracy and Freedom! Partiya Demokrate Kurdistan!"

ott.23.e:0 "Our People, Our Land, Our Future! Partiya Serbokho!"

ott.24.t:0 "Foreign Affairs"
ott.24.d:0 "During the election Partiya Sosyalisti said that if they would win they would seek protection and cooperation from the Internationale, now it is time to decide if we should do so or remain in isolation."
ott.24.a:0 "Try to join the Internationale."
ott.24.b:0 "Isolationism will protect Kurdistan."

ott.25.t:0 "Kurdistan In The Internationale?"
ott.25.d:0 "Our Socialist friends in Kurdistan want to join the Internationale, hoping that membership in our alliance will protect the independence of their newborn state. Although some eager officers are arguing for the immediate acceptance of Kurdistan into the Internationale, most of them are against such a drastic move, and opt for a simple guarantee of their independence."
ott.25.a:0 "Invite Kurdistan into the Internationale!"
ott.25.b:0 "Just guarantee their independence."
ott.25.c:0 "No, we have no interests there."

ott.26.t:0 "Kurdistan Joins The Internationale"

ott.27.t:0 "The Internationale Guarantees Kurdistan"
ott.27.d:0 "Our French comrades are reluctant to make us a full member of the Internationale, for now they have decided to guarantee our independence instead."

ott.28.t:0 "The Internationale Rejects Kurdistan!"
ott.28.d:0 "Unbelievable! Those traitors in the Commune of France have rejected our request to join the Internationale!"
ott.28.a:0 "Fransa bize bohmir."

ott.29.t:0 "The Ottoman Public Debt Administration"
ott.29.d:0 "Founded in 1881 the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (OPDA) was an European-controlled organisation that monitored and collected debt owed by the Ottoman State to European creditors in the private and public sectors. Most of the debt had been owed to French and British government as well as private institutions and had, as a consequence, been unilaterally defaulted by the Ottoman government when revolution swept away the regimes in London and Paris. However, the OPDA is still in existence and is now fully controlled by German and Austrian administrators, mainly concerned with regaining the capital loaned to Kostantiniyye during the Weltkrieg."
ott.29.a:0 "With friends like these..."

ott.30.t:0 "Hejazi Dissatisfaction"
ott.30.d:0 "Increasing levels of Arab nationalism are spreading dissatisfaction among our subjects and the independent states of the Arabian peninsula are a constant symbol of freedom from control of Kostantiniyye.

ott.30.b:0 "Grant more autonomy to local governments."

ott.31.t:0 "Arab Nationalist Tensions"
ott.31.d:0 "The 25th anniversary of our entry into the Weltkrieg is approaching on October 28th and Arab nationalists are using the event as an excuse to protest against the government. This time angry crowds risk the outbreak of violence and potentially even open rebellion. How shall we respond?"
ott.31.a:0 "C'mon guys, I thought we are all Muslims here?"
ott.31.b:0 "Send in the Gendarmerie and local inzibat units."

ott.32.t:0 "25th Anniversary of War Sparks Riots"
ott.32.d:0 "The 25th anniversary of our entry into the Weltkrieg has sparked angry riots as Arab nationalists take to the streets to show their discontent with the Ottoman government. Police are having a hard time keeping control of the situation and many local officers have joined the rioters."
ott.32.a:0 "Fine, let them be free if that's what they want."

ott.39.a:0 "Another revolt!"

ott.40.t:0 "Cypriot Uprising!"
ott.40.d:0 "With regions inhabited by Cypriot Greeks declaring independence from us, the stability of our empire is further endangered.

ott.43.b:0 "Never!"

ott.44.t:0 "Support The Cypriots?"
ott.44.d:0 "The Greek inhabitants of Cyprus people have risen against their Ottoman overlords, wanting to finally break free from them. This presents us with the option to significantly weaken the Ottoman Empire via supporting the Cypriot independence movement..."

ott.79.d:0 "Our old ally, The Ottoman Empire, wants to buy military aircraft designs from German companies. Several aircraft manufacturers have notified us because German law states that the sale of weapons to foreign buyers must be approved by the government first. Shall we allow our companies to sell aircraft blueprints to the Turks?"

ott.85.t:0 "The Sultan's Speech"
ott.85.d:0 "His Majesty the Sultan [Root.GetLeader] delivered an Imperial Address in the Ottoman House of Commons today, recalling the events of the last decade and outlining his great plans for the future. The brief and eloquent speech had a spectacular effect on the multitude of state officials who had gathered to hear the Sultan speak - the several minutes of applause that followed the oration could be heard from across the Bosporus. In his magnificent 'Nutk-ı Hümayun', His Imperial Majesty had talked a great deal about many important subjects like democracy and the parliament, and yet nobody knew what exactly was on the Sultan's mind."
ott.85.a:0 "A sign of great things to come."

ott.86.t:0 "Ottoman Parliament Dissolved"
ott.86.d:0 "At [GetDateText], soldiers entered the Cemile Sultan Palace to disband the Ottoman Parliament. Citing the Imperial Decree of Sultan [Root.GetLeader], Ottoman inzibat units ended the session by force, and all members of parliament were escorted outside the palace grounds. Another 'İrâde-i Seniyye' that went into effect an hour later effectively suspended the constitution and enforced a media blackout that aimed to suppress all information about the dissolution of the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies. Nevertheless, the news quickly spread throughout the capital and the rest of the empire. Though many viewed this as an irrational and impulsive move on part of [Root.GetLeader], some liberal groups were convinced that this was only the beginning of the end."
ott.86.a:0 "No longer shall we suffer from two-headedness."

ott.87.t:0 "Shut down the political parties?"
ott.87.d:0 "Following the dissolvement of the Parliament, political parties of all ideologies began criticising the decision, with liberal ideologues even going so far as to call the Imperial Decrees 'tyrannical'. Opposition to the Sultan is growing day by day, and even the resident monarchists in the Selamet-i Osmaniye Party are having a hard time defending the situation, meanwhile several spontaneous protests have materialised in the capital. Should we really allow these pesky agitators to roam free in the city?"
ott.87.a:0 "Proceed with the arrests of politicians."
ott.87.b:0 "Allow them to exist and operate freely."

ott.88.t:0 "Protesters gather in front of Dolmabahçe Palace"

ott.88.a:0 "Arrest these filthy marauders."
ott.88.b:0 "Do nothing, they will give up eventually."

ott.89.t:0 "The Galata Massacre"
ott.89.d:0 "An army patrol opened fire on hostile protesters in the affluent Galata quarter of Kostantiniyye late last night. Although the soldiers involved claim that they felt genuinely threatened and fired only when the mob advanced, the public is unlikely to believe their story."
ott.89.a:0 "This does not bode well..."

ott.90.t:0 "The New Reformers?"
ott.90.d:0 "The massacre at Galata provoked a major outrage from the public. Following a series of threats from more extremist and disgruntled sectors of our society, major opposition parties, and also pressure from the army high command, the undersecretary of Ministry of the Interior proposed the reinstatement of Constitution, and a major reshuffling of our government in order to appease the dissenters and maybe bring some stability back to the Empire. Shall we proceed?"
ott.90.a:0 "What are you waiting for? Swear them in!"
ott.90.b:0 "Supress the malcontents by force of arms!"

ott.91.t:0 "Mob Violence In Kostantiniyye"
ott.91.d:0 "General unrest has turned into rioting and mob rule in our capital! Various left-wing groups were spotted among the rioters as protesters clashed with the security forces and started damaging public buildings. As the initially civil protests quickly deteriorated into vandalism and anarchy, they began to lose their support among the conservative sections of the Ottoman public. Reports of inebriated rebels loitering near the Dolmabahçe Palace and its attached Mosque were quickly publicised by pro-government newspapers."
ott.91.a:0 "Those drunks entered the mosque with their shoes on!"

ott.92.t:0 "Prince Sabahaddin Agitates!"
ott.92.d:0 "Prince Mehmed Sabahaddin, leader of the Liberal Entente, has started organising protests against what he calls 'The Tyranny of Absolute Rule'. A grandson of Abdülmecid I and related to the House of Osman through his mother, the veteran liberal politician is on the forefront of the opposition movement. It would be wise to drive him out of this country, if our reforms are to succeed..."
ott.92.a:0 "Force him into exile!"
ott.92.b:0 "Let him agitate."

ott.93.t:0 "Organised Opposition"
ott.93.d:0 "Opposition politicians appear to have succeeded in their coordinated efforts to deceive the Ottoman people about our latest leadership reforms, and as a result our popular support is lower than ever..."
ott.93.a:0 "They will not halt our progress!"

ott.94.t:0 "Protests Dissipate"
ott.94.d:0 "Following several weeks of anarchy and rioting on the streets of Kostantiniyye, the protests eventually died down. While damage to public buildings and services were minimal, damage to the credibility of the protesters was immense. The conservative Ottoman public, always wary of chaos and instability, had chosen to side with the Sultan. As a new era dawned on The Ottoman Empire, Sultan [Root.GetLeader] stood strong with the support of the majority behind him."
ott.94.a:0 "We will have order in our Empire!"

ott.95.t:0 "Sublime Committee for Constitution"
ott.95.d:0 "Our illustrious Sultan [Root.GetLeader] announced today his welcoming support for a new Constitution that would seek to address the issues of a new century. Under his benevolent guidance, a Sublime Committee for Constitution is to be formed of law experts and members of major political parties."
ott.95.a:0 "Long live the Empire!"

ott.96.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - The Ottoman State"
ott.96.d:0 "The Sublime Committee for Constitution has been working tirelessly to write our new Constitution. The Parliament has started the process of approving the independent Articles and submitting them for ratification by His Majesty the Sultan.\n\nArticle 1. The Ottoman Empire comprises present territory and possessions, and semi-dependent provinces. It forms an indivisible whole, from which no portion can be detached under any pretext whatever.\nArticle 2. Kostantiniyye is the capital of the Ottoman Empire.\nArticle 3. Islam is the state religion. The state will protect the free exercise of faiths professed in the Empire, and uphold the religious privileges granted to various bodies.\nArticle 4. Turkish is the official language, and is required to hold public office."
ott.96.a:0 "Approved."

ott.97.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - The Sultan"
ott.97.d:0 "Article 5. The Ottoman sovereignty, which holds the title of the Supreme Caliph of Islam, belongs to the eldest prince of the House of Osman, in accordance with the rules established ab antiquo.\nArticle 6. His Majesty the Sultan, in his role as Supreme Caliph, is protector of the Muslim religion. He is the sovereign and padişah of all Ottomans.\nArticle 7. His Majesty the Sultan is irresponsible, his person is sacred.\nArticle 8. The liberties, properties real and personal, and the civil list of the members of the Ottoman Dynasty are under the guarantee of all."
ott.97.a:0 "By God, approved!"

ott.98.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Sovereign Rights of the Sultan"
ott.98.d:0 "Article 9. Among the sovereign rights of His Majesty the Sultan are the following prerogatives: he makes and cancels the appointments of ministers; he confers the grades, functions and insignia of his orders, and confers investiture on the governors of provinces, according to forms determined by the privileges granted them; he has the coining of money; his name is read at the Friday Sermons; he concludes treaties with the powers; he declares war and makes peace; he commands the land and sea forces; he directs military movements; he carries out the provisions of the Sacred Law, and of the other laws; he sees to the administration of public measures; he respites or commutes sentences pronounced by the criminal courts."
ott.98.a:0 "Approved."

Every Ottoman enjoys personal liberty on condition of not interfering with the liberty of others.\nArticle 12. Personal liberty is wholly inviolable. No one can suffer punishment, under any pretext whatsoever, except in cases determined by law, and according to the forms prescribed by it.\nArticle 13. All Ottomans are equal in the eyes of the law. They have the same rights, and owe the same duties towards their country, without prejudice to religion.\nArticle 14. All Ottomans are admitted to public offices, according to their fitness, merit, and ability."
ott.99.a:0 "Approved."

ott.100.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Houses of Parliament"
ott.100.d:0 "In the Constitution of 1876, the Houses of Parliament were established comprising of a Lower House (Meclis-i Mebusan) and an Upper House (Meclis-i Âyan). The Grand Vizier, handpicked by the Sultan, presided over the Houses of Parliament. The liberal members of the Committee are arguing that the Grand Vizier (and by extension, rest of the government) should be decided by votes, and not by an Imperial Decision of the Monarch."
ott.100.a:0 "The Sultan will appoint the Grand Vizier."
ott.100.b:0 "The Government shall be formed by the Parliament."

ott.101.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Parliamentary Schedule"
ott.101.d:0 "In the old constitution, Sultan had the rights to open, prorogue, and dissolve the parliament. As there had been a notorious occasion when Sultan Abdülhamid II abused his powers to prorogue the Parliament and not call another session for 30 years, many liberal members of the Sublime Committee are wary of allowing such powers again. What shall be the decision?"
ott.101.a:0 "The Sultan opens and dissolves the parliament."
ott.101.b:0 "Parliament schedule is set by the Constitution."

ott.102.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Veto Rights"
ott.102.d:0 "Another contentious issue was the veto rights of the Sultan. Monarchist and conservative members of the Committee insisted that Sultan, whom represents the collective will of the Ottoman Public, should have unchallenged veto powers, while liberal MP's pushed for the supremacy of the Parliament."
ott.102.a:0 "The Sultan gets the last word."
ott.102.b:0 "A veto can be overturned by two-thirds majority."

ott.103.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Right to Petition"
ott.103.d:0 "Article 63 of the Constitution states that 'One or more persons of Ottoman nationality have the right of presenting petitions in the proper quarter relating to the breaking of law and regulation, and may likewise present in protest signed petitions to the General Ottoman Assembly, complaining of the conduct of state servants and functionaries.'\n\nWhile this article by itself seems sufficiently just, several members of the Sublime Committee suggested that minorities should be explicitly allowed to present petitions in local languages, as not stating this would allow a loophole where local governments could arbitrarily decide not to process petitions written in languages other than Turkish."
ott.103.a:0 "Allow petitions written in local languages."
ott.103.b:0 "If they want to complain, they should learn Turkish."

ott.104.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Rights of Trade Unions"
ott.104.d:0 "The issue of the rights of the trade unions and syndicates was a dreaded one, as both liberals and conservatives were wary of syndicalist factions gaining excessive powers. Three articles were composed after careful deliberation, aiming to give sufficient rights to the workers and limit syndicalist influence."
ott.104.a:0 "Allow all trade unions, strikes and lockouts."
ott.104.b:0 "Such godless syndicalism has no place in the Ottoman Empire!"

ott.105.t:0 "The New Constitution is Declared!"
ott.105.d:0 "The new Ottoman Constitution was declared in the front garden of ancient Topkapı Palace today, with an accompanying ceremony and military parade. May our new 'Kanun-u Esasi' be auspicious!"
ott.105.a:0 "Long live the Sultan!"

ott.106.t:0 "Independence of the Judiciary"
ott.106.d:0 "Our chief legal experts argue that in the decision-making process, judges should have freedom to decide cases impartially, in accordance with their interpretation of the law and the facts; that they should be able to act without any restriction or improper influence. They claim that one of the most important standards underpinning the autonomy of the judiciary is immovability, that is, for ordinary judges to be appointed permanently until retirement. Shall we give such guarantees of independence to our judges?"
ott.106.a:0 "We must ensure the independence of our Judiciary."
ott.106.b:0 "They shall have parliamentary oversight."
ott.106.c:0 "I am the law."

ott.107.t:0 "Centralisation or Decentralisation?"
ott.107.d:0 "While the Article 108 of the Ottoman Constitution declares that the vilayets shall be governed by the principle of 'decentralisation', this de jure principle has never transformed into action. Now that our sweeping administrative reforms are under way, the proponents of the doctrine of 'Adem-i Merkeziyet' are again asserting that subordinating local decision-making to the central bureaucracy results in tremendous inefficiency and pointless delays. With our distant subjects chafing under the direct rule of Kostantiniyye, it would be wise to give more power to local governments over our centrally-appointed governors. Shall we grant greater powers and freedoms to the administrative councils of our Vilayets?"
ott.107.a:0 "More power to the local governments!"
ott.107.b:0 "Frankly, I don't see the need for reform."

ott.108.t:0 "Indifference to New Laws"
ott.108.d:0 "Even though we made many changes to administrative law during the course of legal reforms, we are receiving numerous reports of regulators and bureaucrats completely disregarding the new laws, especially the ones concerning anti-corruption measures."
ott.108.a:0 "What is this insolence?!"

ott.109.t:0 "Interference in Courts!"
ott.109.d:0 "In former days, local administrators and military governors could freely interfere with legal proceedings, and sometimes even upturn court decisions. Such interference, coupled with corruption, quickly gave rise to injustice and public discontent. And although with our judicial reforms we aimed to prevent any such events from occurring again in the future, we are still receiving petitions from aggrieved peasants detailing high-level interference in courts of law."
ott.109.a:0 "Who dares interrupt justice?"

ott.110.t:0 "Ineffective Administration"
ott.110.d:0 "It has been several months since we formally adopted the metric system and the Standard Ottoman script, but we are still receiving troubling reports of incompetent bureaucrats being completely unable to use the new standards of measurement, while dozens of nearly-illiterate government officials have been discovered after they have proved incapable of deciphering the new form of official writing. It appears that the full implementation of these reforms will take more time than anticipated."
ott.110.a:0 "Who hired all these useless officials?!"

ott.111.t:0 "Corrupt Bureaucracy"
ott.111.d:0 "The notoriously widespread corruption in the Ottoman bureaucracy is a long-established phenomenon. Over the centuries, low wages and even lower moral standards of Ottoman government officials resulted in the gradual acceptance and normalisation of bribery as a means of income. Legitimised under terms such as 'hediye' and 'caize', corruption became so commonplace that several Ottoman sultans were recorded to have accepted bribes. Many efforts to curtail corruption were made over the centuries, none of them successful. Unfortunately, it seems that our coordinated efforts to end bribery are about to meet the same fate. The reforms we instituted, which include new laws and severe penalties, are being casually disregarded by the old-headed bureaucrats, almost all of whom are feeling quite secure in their entrenched positions in the government. Several reports we have received indicate that any action taken against these corrupt officials are quickly covered-up by complicit superiors and high officials. It appears that eliminating corruption will not be an easy task."
ott.111.a:0 "Reinstitute the anti-bribery oath!"

ott.112.t:0 "Report on Corruption"
ott.112.d:0 "Today we received a very troubling report concerning the unlawful use of crown lands in Yalova. According to this report, several bureaucrats from the Treasury are colluding with local administrators in Yalova in order to embezzle from Mukataa farmland revenues. Yet another group in the same region is illegally renting out Royal Property belonging to the nieces of the Sultan. The report further claims that both groups are being protected through shady bookkeeping in the Ministry of Interior. According to our royal accountants, this shameless act of robbery is costing us up to millions of lire every year! Should we investigate these claims?"
ott.112.a:0 "I want action on this!"
ott.112.b:0 "Let it slide, this is too dangerous."

ott.113.t:0 "Police Chief Murdered!"
ott.113.d1:0 "Terrible news! Muharrem Arif Paşa, head of Emniyet-i Umumiye, was murdered outside his house this morning! On Sultan's orders, Muharrem Arif Paşa was leading the 'Royal Investigation into Corruption' concerning the embezzlement of Yalova crown land revenues. Several witnesses reported seeing two assassins firing at Muharrem Paşa from an unmarked white car before driving away. There is no doubt that the assassination is linked to the Yalova case, and the search for the white car is already under way."
ott.113.d2:0 "Terrible news! Muharrem Arif Paşa, head of Emniyet-i Umumiye, was murdered outside his house this morning!

ott.114.t:0 "Officials Implicated In The Embezzlement Affair"
ott.114.d1:0 "Following the trail of paperwork from the crown lands, our detective inspectors were able to uncover how the crown revenues were embezzled. Eight officials from the Treasury, three administrators from Yalova and the Undersecretary of Interior were found to be stealing the funds through a series of transactions. The police are ready to make the arrests, but arresting such high officials could lead to other unforeseen complications. Shall we issue the arrests?"

ott.114.b:0 "Pardon the offenders and end the investigation."

ott.115.t:0 "Evidence Points To Teceddüt"
ott.115.d:0 "The Yalova arrests attracted great attention, and were protested by several prominent politicians, Mehmed Cavid Bey of Teceddüt Party foremost among them. From the preliminary reports, it appears that many of the corrupt officials had connections to the Teceddüt and Selamet-i Osmaniye Parties, and the Undersecretary of the Interior currently under arrest was a close relative of Mehmed Cavid Bey, who nominated him for the position in 1917 during his time as Minister of Finance. And even though the money trail does not reach Mehmed Cavid Bey, evidence conclusively shows that he worked to cover-up the scandal and protect the corrupt officials through his political connections. Should we take action against these politicians?"
ott.115.a:0 "Arrest them! No exceptions!"
ott.115.b:0 "Forgive all offenders, end the investigation."

ott.116.t:0 "Constantinople Corps prevents arrests"
ott.116.d:0 "Police officers attempting to arrest Mehmed Cavid Bey and 7 other politicians were blocked by soldiers of the Constantinople Corps today. Army units prevented the arrests and took Mehmed Cavid Bey and the others into hiding at an unknown location. There is great confusion as to what is happening."
ott.116.a:0 "What's going on?!"

ott.117.t:0 "Armed Putsch"
ott.117.d:0 "The situation rapidly descended into chaos as soldiers from the Constantinople Corps took to the streets and martial law was declared. Within an hour, army units took control of the Sublime Porte, major roads, bridges and telegraph stations across the city. A battalion of soldiers led by two armed civilians were also reported to be moving towards the Royal Palace."
ott.117.a:0 "Uh oh..."

ott.118.t:0 "The Palace Raid"
ott.118.d1:0 "The putsch reached the palace as an army battalion forced its way into Dolmabahçe. After killing 4 royal guards defending the entrance, soldiers and armed civilians entered palace grounds. Sporadic resistance was offered by palace guards once inside the building. According to an unconfirmed report, the putschists burst into the Royal Chambers of Sultan Abdülmecid II and tried to force his abdication. Unexpectedly, the old and stubborn Sultan pulled out his gold-engraved revolver with a shaky hand, and a terrible firefight ensued. Sultan Abdülmecid II and three of his personal guards were slain in the fighting. Undeterred, the putschists captured Ahmed Nihad Efendi and proclaimed him the new Sultan. It appears that we have no choice but to accept this terrible turn of events!"
ott.118.d2:0 "The putsch reached the palace as an army battalion forced its way into Dolmabahçe.

According to an unconfirmed report, Sultan Ahmed IV barricaded himself in his Royal Chambers as the putschists approached. After an hour of siege, the soldiers managed to break through the door and a terrible firefight ensued. Sultan Ahmed IV and his personal guards were slain in the fighting. Undeterred, the putschists captured Ömer Faruk Efendi and proclaimed him the new Sultan. It appears that we have no choice but to accept this terrible turn of events!"

In full ceremonial uniform, armed with lance, carbine and cavalry sabers, the household cavalry charged downhill to the Dolmabahçe palace and crushed the paramilitary rebels positioned outside. Assaulting the palace itself, they chased the rebels through the building, and rescued [Root.GetLeader]. Osman Fuad was reportedly enraged to find the Sultan murdered and swore justice would be done.

Encountering no resistance at the Parliament, Osman Fuad positioned his infantry to defend the main road and marched on with his cavalry. The elite Ertuğrul Cavalry Regiment soon reached the Galata Bridge, held by rebel paramilitary units. The regiment - who regularly crossed this bridge every week to join the Sultan in Ayasofya Mosque - defeated the rebels on the northern side and charged across the bridge to rout the rebels on the southern side.

Our people, however, have no interest in going to war again so soon, so the government has come up with a possible solution to the problem: in exchange for [PER.GetNameDef] abandoning their claims on Iraq, [PER.GetNameDef] will be granted full control over the neutral Kurdistan buffer zone.

ottaxis.201.d:0 "Now that the Ottoman Empire has been defeated, thanks to a united effort from our allies in the Cairo Pact and with great help from [PER.GetNameDef], we must now split the spoils between us. [PER.GetNameDef], having done a great deal against the Ottomans, took their claims first and restricted their gains solely to what they promised they would occupy. Now we must decide what to do with our own gains."

ottaxis.202.a:0 "The Ottomans fall as we begin to rise."

ottaxis.203.t:0 "The Treaty of [266.GetName]"
ottaxis.203.d:0 "Betrayal! With [PER.GetNameDef] heading the peace negotiations with the Ottomans, it has handed the Hejaz over to the control of the Egyptians...and they have decided to keep it! There is nothing left for us to take. Thousands of Arab soldiers died fighting for a united Arabia, and yet we get nothing from it. The Cairo Pact alliance evidently meant nothing to the Egyptians, and [PER.GetNameDef] is filling the void the Ottomans left."
ottaxis.203.a:0 "Clearly there is no point to the Pact."

ottaxis.204.t:0 "The Treaty of [266.GetName]"
ottaxis.204.d:0 "The Ottomans have been defeated, but with [PER.GetNameDef] taking the lead in the peace negotiations we have discovered they are claiming far more land in the Levant than they promised. This leaves us with very little, and our allies with almost nothing."
ottaxis.204.a:0 "Take the Levant and leave the rest to our allies."
ottaxis.204.b:0 "We will keep what we did get, no matter what the Arabians think."
ottaxis.204.c:0 "This will have to suffice."

ottaxis.205.d:0 "The [PER.GetAdjective] government has taken the lead in peace negotiations with the Ottomans, but somehow after all is said and done it is we who end up with nothing to show for our efforts. The Egyptians say that they cannot give us a Hejaz the Ottomans do not own, and perhaps that is true... but why then did all our soldiers perish on the battlefield?"
ottaxis.205.a:0 "We need our alliance, even if this is a disappointment."
ottaxis.205.b:0 "We have no further need of the Pact, then."

ottaxis.300.d:0 "Ever since the British started meddling in Egypt, our grip over the region has started to wane. The abolishment of the Khedivate in 1914 and the forced abdication of our Khediv Abbas II, was nothing but a slap in the face of our Sultan and sew great distrust between ourselves, the British and the Egyptians who did nothing to aid us during the Weltkrieg.\n\nNow the tables have turned however and it is Fuad I who has been forced into exile, paving the way for the restoration of Abbas II and a new era of Otto-Egyptian cooperation."
