### Leaders ###
POLITICS_AHMED_SHARIF_DESC:0 "The third-generation ruler of the Senussi Order of Tripolitania, Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi inherited a precarious role from his father, Muhammad Idris. Compliance with the Ottoman Caliphate was never fully embraced by the many Sufis in Tripolitania. The Weltkrieg broke the Senussi solidarity, and Ahmed Sharif fell out of favour to his cousin Idris, who was declared Al Mahdi as Senussi during the crisis. Thanks to an army raised by Ottoman General Nuri Killigil, Ahmed Sharif was able to oust Idris and force him into exile in Egypt. Italy's dissolution provided the prextext to invade Fezzan, and thus Ahmed Sharif became the first King of Tripolitania under Ottoman protection. A newfound hostility has found Ahmed adrift from his former allies in Al Ahzar university in Cairo, with his subordinates slowly being replaced by Turkish yes men and foreign trained intellectuals."
POLITICS_RAMADAN_SEWEHELI_DESC:0 "A survivor of the Republic of Tripolitania, Ramadan was forgiven by the Senussi Order due to his popularity in Tripolitania and was able to get a minor post in government until today. Through international assistance, Ramadan has recreated the Republic to represent all Libyan people oppressed and divided. His policies towards modernisation has drawn a lot of critics, especially his decision to mandate Italian over French as the second language of Libya."
POLITICS_SHARIF_GARIANI_DESC:0 "Hailing from a pious Senussi family in Bayda, Sharif El Gariani served as a Senussi leader and took an orphan named Omar Mukhtar into his order after Omar's family had died. Sharif came to regret this in 1911 when the Italians came to Cyrenica. A pragmatist and a pacifist, Sharif yielded to the Italians. His ward Omar instigated the people of Bayda into resistance against the Italians and Sharif. Omar's loyalists left Sharif to tend to the casualties of war, these victims would later remember Sharif's dedication to survival, and elected him leader of the Republic. Sharif has renewed his dedication to the Libyan people, and lamented that Omar could have been a greater leader if he cooperated with the wider world."
POLITICS_HUSSEIN_MAZIQ_DESC:0 "Born at the tail end of the Italian occupation, Hussein Maziq was the son of a patriotic resistance fighter in Benghazi. Maziq's family submitted to the Senussi order when Idris reclaimed the land from the Italians, and were put in touch with the legendary commander Omar Mukhtar. Maziq covertly supported Idris in exile, and simultaneously educated himself in Italian and French to work with industrialists. When the Second Weltkrieg came to Tripolitania, his organisation helped people evacuate to Algiers. Now this reputation has become known, and the grateful people of Libya have elected him President."
POLITICS_ABU_MENIAR_DESC:0 "Among the Qadhadhfa, very few would have expected an illiterate Bedouin to rise in the alien ideology of socialism. But when the Italians were occupying Qasr Abu Hadi, the illiterate Abu Meniar bought schoolbooks in Italian. His journey towards literacy in Italian continued after their army retreated, and his fascination with changes happening in Europe led him to move his family to Tripoli in 1923. Tripoli being the centre for Italian expats, Abu Meniar began reading Il Popolo d'Italia. Mussolinis strive for the unity of Italian people to overcome poverty led Meinar to ingratiate himself with the right people. Upon the rightful succession of the Internationale, Abu Meinar became their most trusted associate."

### Focuses ###
LBA_army:0 "Military of the Order"
LBA_army_desc:0 "The Senussi Order fought bravely, fought together, and still they lost to Italy on the battlefield. While concessions were made at the peace table, our defeats highlighted weaknesses that could yet be exploited by our foes, particularly in the event of pitched warfare."
LBA_equipments_tactics:0 "Modern Infantry"
LBA_equipments_tactics_desc:0 "Modern warfare has a distinctly unique focus on infantry, especially given the range, power and precision of handguns. With some help from friends abroad, we can an ensure said newer guns are in our possession."
LBA_guns_butter:0 "Better Guns"
LBA_guns_butter_desc:0 "Improving the quality of the weapons our soldiers use is a fundamental priority of national defence; however, our current lack of native industrial capacity complicates matters. We must ensure that we have the best possible handguns in our possession."

LBA_specialist_training:0 "Specialist Training"
LBA_specialist_training_desc:0 "Every army has its elite, its heroes who are willing to do what has to be done. However, the training of modern, combat-capable elite regiments is not as simple as it once was, and we must ensure that our nation has the capacity to field such special forces."
LBA_trucks:0 "Motorised Warfare"
LBA_trucks_desc:0 "Our homeland is defined by its geography, and the ability to quickly outmanoeuvre enemies through mountains and deserts is key to victory in modern warfare; however, infantry is often too slow to catch up to our horsemen. But in this new age of warfare, perhaps they will be to fast for the horses?"
LBA_bedouins:0 "Horsemen of Tripolitania"
LBA_bedouins_desc:0 "The Senoussi Order and the men that fought for it have always used the loyal steeds of these lands to protect us. For centuries the horsemen of the nation have answered the call to war, and as a new age of war approaches, they shall do so again. They may now be equipped differently in arms, but not in spirit and bravery."
LBA_planning:0 "Planned Offensives"
LBA_planning_desc:0 "We must face the realities of being a minor nation stuck between opposing spheres of influence; whether we like it or not, war will come to our shores. The choice stands between properly planning for it, or leaving our destiny in the hands of fate."
LBA_fast_move:0 "Desert Mobility"
LBA_fast_move_desc:0 "Our main advantage in the Weltkrieg against the Italians was our capacity to to outmanoeuvre the Empire's forces, thanks to the ingenuity of our men and our knowledge of our lands. Our forces are always one step ahead of invaders, and pitched battle not always is the answer to our struggle."
LBA_adaptability:0 "Strategic Adaptability"
LBA_adaptability_desc:0 "War is an ever changing science, and our methods are simply too outdated to grant us victory against an organised, and well-supplied opponent. We must ensure that the equipment and tactics gap between our nation and the major powers is bridged as soon as we can, even if this could come at a considerable cost."
LBA_excercises:0 "Military Exercises"
LBA_excercises_desc:0 "He who desires peace must be prepared for war, and we know that no matter what comes in these challenging times, war is sure to test our mettle. We must ensure that our men are as ready as possible to face real combat!"
LBA_seting_up_perimiters:0 "Defending our Homes"
LBA_seting_up_perimiters_desc:0 "The Senoussi's struggle for the defence of our home was long and bloody. With no hope of support, we valiantly stood against the steel of the empire of the Italians, but not with brute force, rather, with mastery of the battlefield and the terrain of our homeland."
LBA_desert_warfare:0 "Desert Warfare Expertise"
LBA_desert_warfare_desc:0 "Each of our officers will have local attaches and guides, and every division will have its own hideout if need be.

LBA_equipments_needs:0 "Need of Equipment"
LBA_equipments_needs_desc:0 "The fighting capacity of an army can only go as far as their weaponry. Not only do our men have a lack of guns, but we lack proper, modern artillery pieces, machine guns and many other instruments of war that will undoubtedly be necessary in the coming storm."
LBA_improvisation:0 "Equipment Improvisation"
LBA_improvisation_desc:0 "Sometimes a few corners have to be cut. We don't need the best wood, or the best steel, or the best gunpowder... we need our men ready for combat and martyrdom for the homeland!"
LBA_army_railways:0 "Army Railways"
LBA_army_railways_desc:0 "Logistic supllies for a large scale army is no easy feat, and cannot propely be done via supply caravans. We must ensure that we have a link from Tripoli to all main auxiliary army HQs."
LBA_navy_ports:0 "Ports in Cyrenaica"
LBA_navy_ports_desc:0 "Cyrenaica currently lacks the infrastructure to supply a large army, and much of it will have to be sent overseas. To ensure that the supply capacity of the region meets general staff demands, the port of Benghazi is to be expanded."
LBA_military_fact:0 "Military Production"
LBA_military_fact_desc:0 "We currently lack the structures necessary for a proper arsenal, one that will truly make the weapons we need in the needed time frame. And time is of the essence, as war approaches our land ever rapidly."
LBA_build:0 "Military Construction"

LBA_indtech:0 "Industrial Development"
LBA_indtech_desc:0 "Our nation is a very rural one, and little industrial development has occurred so far. We must however ensure that basic state needs are met."
LBA_black_monday_1:0 "Dealing With Black Monday"

LBA_civvie_1:0 "Construction Investment"
LBA_civvie_1_desc:0 "State construction efforts are expensive but much needed endeavours, and often the most tangible way to show the populace the prosperity our rule over this land gives them!"
LBA_black_monday_2:0 "End of the Storm"
LBA_black_monday_2_desc:0 "While only a tangential target of Black Monday, we can certainly say that a severe blow was dealt to the growth of our young nation. Now, we must re-adjust our budget and sail foward; it seems that the worst is long over."
LBA_civfac_2:0 "Construction & Consumer Goods Focus"
LBA_civfac_2_desc:0 "As our state construction plan is under way, we now shift towards using newly built factories to make consumer goods, so as to reduce our dependency on the imports of these especially in times of war; a much needed if expensive measure."
LBA_infra:0 "Start Tripoli-Benghazi Railway"
LBA_infra_desc:0 "The government has planned the TBR since early after the Weltkrieg, but only now with the proper backing can we start the project and make this long-standing ambition a reality."
LBA_indtech2:0 "Industrial Advances"

LBA_oasis_help:0 "Helping the Tribes"
LBA_oasis_help_desc:0 "Throughout the land, many tribesmen live a harsh life, one with much hardship and challenges every day.

LBA_infra3:0 "Finish the Tripoli Railway"
LBA_infra3_desc:0 "Our national railway network nears completion; now we only need one final effort to pull us through this great challenge!"
LBA_el_techslot:0 "National Education Reform"
LBA_el_techslot_desc:0 "Our educational system is barely non-existent; the few schools and madrasahs only accept those fortunate enough to be able to afford them and this greatly hinders the potential of the nation. That is something that we must change if we are not to fall behind to our enemies on every field."
LBA_fortess_tripoli:0 "Fortress Tripoli"
LBA_fortess_tripoli_desc:0 "Our land is surrounded by potentially hostile powers, all aching to impose their will over us. However, as long as Tripoli holds, our land is not yet lost. And we will hold, for we will build fortifications all round the city, turning it into a veritable fortress."

LBA_ifriqya:0 "Lord of Africa"
LBA_ifriqya_desc:0 "For centuries, the Lordship of Africa has been vacant. Our lands have been pawns in the chessboard of the great Turk, little resembling the land that brought so much advancement and wealth to the world in its Golden Age.

LBA_raiders_subbo:0 "Submarine Manufacturing"
LBA_raiders_subbo_desc:0 "Making a submarine is far more than making a ship that can go underwater. It must be able to use our ammunition, have operational autonomy, and we must minimise the time spent near the surface to avoid being seen. Tricky issues that need to be tackled in intelligent ways, but we have ways."
LBA_distorya:0 "Anti-Submarine Vessels"
LBA_distorya_desc:0 "It would be foolish not to realise that we, too, are vulnerable to submarine raids; and we will outfit special ships for this roles from our shipyards, and protect our shores from sneaky invaders."

LBA_close_range_desc:0 "Controlling the skies is only a means to an end; this end is to utterly control the battlefield and ensure that our enemies cannot hope to succeed in their quest to end all we hold dear.

### Events ###
libya.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Tripolitania"
libya.1.d:0 "The modern-day monarchy of Tripolitania was founded by the Senussi Order after the Weltkrieg with the support and protection of the Ottoman Empire. When Ahmed Sharif's forces were defeated in the early Libyan front of the Weltkireg, Idris, his cousin, took the helm and carefully manouvered the Order to successfully survive the conflict. When Italy was dissolved in 1919, the existing rebel state of the Republic of Tripolitania was incoporated under the authority of the Order, and the Kingdom of Tripolitania was born, with its authority extending through Fezzen and Cyrenaica. The Ottomans, wary of losing regional influence, installed Ahmed Sharif as King of Tripoli, and Idris was forced into exile in Egypt. The Ottoman influence in Tripolitania was recognised by the Peace with Honour, as were its borders with British Egypt. In the years since then, Tripolitania has enjoyed peace and calm; save of course for the fact that the Senoussi had to quash a few Republican radicals in late 1919. Ottoman rule is barely felt in any distinguishable way, and the order that the Kingdom brought has been beneficial for its small economy. As long as no significant shakeups happen to our status quo, little upheaval will befall Tripolitania."

libya.9.t:0 "Ifriqya Rises!"
libya.9.d:0 "After centuries, finally again emerges an African leader capable of uniting the Province of Africa into one state. While vising and oberving diplomats are already calling our state Ifriqya, so as to differentiate it from the name given the to wider continent, they bask in the glory of a nation that successfully sent the European empires packing - no mean feat!"

libya.14.d:0 "As events continue to unfold on the world stage of the Great Powers, Idris al-Senoussi has quietly taken control of Tripolitania and begun reconstructing the state that he tore from Ottoman control. While we obviously have more pressing matters than to worry about every petty tyrant barbarian in Africa, this Idris is determined to take the fight to us at some point, as he has publicly stated multiple times in recent months, in the name of such nonsense like 'African Liberation'."

libya.20.d:0 "As agreed by our joint war effort plans, two small guard divisions have arrived to defend our ports to enable our forces to focus on dealing with Egypt more directly near the border."
libya.20.a:0 "The Porte knows best!"
libya.21.t:0 "Republican Uprising Crushed!"
libya.21.d:0 "Sadly, not all understand the gravity of our situation or the hard choices we have to make. A band of republicans attempted to launch a coup in Tripoli today, however they were shot down and killed in the dozens. This is a severe blow to republicanism as a whole, but the shock of our brothers fighting each other will linger as a dark cloud, and forever tainting today as a day of Infamy."
libya.21.a:0 "How many times must these foolish children fail before they recognise their folly?"

libya.24.d:0 "As our nation is reborn from foreign oppression, Tunisian and Libyan leaders have been hotly discussing the location of our capital. Three options are available: the old capital of Al Quawiran, Tunis, or Tripoli."
libya.24.a:0 "The seat of Ancient Carthage, Tunis, will again be the capital of Africa."
libya.24.b:0 "Between the two, Al Quawiran will be the seat of our unity government."
libya.24.c:0 "Tripoli remains the beating heart of Africa."
libya.25.t:0 "Tunisia Tensions Decrease"
libya.25.d:0 "After years of rule, Tunisia has grown more and more used to its freedom as a part of Ifriqya. Slowly the removal of French invading institutions and eradication of rebel movements has made our progress towards a united Africa for Africans far more tangible."
libya.25.a:0 "Good!"
libya.26.t:0 "What About the French Attack on Morocco?"
libya.26.d:0 "Morocco, disconnected from other Cairo allies, will need every help it can get in the coming struggle! We should send aid in men and weapons to help it reach victory!"
libya.26.a:0 "It's an ally we can't afford to lose."
libya.26.b:0 "It is rash to deal in such absolute conclusions."

libya.30.d:0 "This event turns Tripolitania into Libya if not under Ottoman rule"
libya.30.a:0 "Huzzah!"
libya.31.t:0 "Egypt Accepts!" # NOT IN USE
libya.31.d:0 "It appears that the Egyptians wisely chose to amend the atrociously ugly border at Kufrah in our favour, forever promising to make our nation both larger and more aesthetically pleasing."
libya.31.a:0 "Thank goodness!"
