### Parties ###
TEX_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
TEX_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America -  The SPA operating in our territory is loyal to the IWW in the CSA, and our relations with them are largely dictated by our relations with them. Nonetheless, machine politics, propaganda and the use of populism to absorb many of their potential voters has left them without a chance of being elected in our region."
TEX_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
TEX_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - The SPA operating in our territory is loyal to the IWW in the CSA, and our relations with them are largely dictated by our relations with them. Nonetheless, machine politics, propaganda and the use of populism to absorb many of their potential voters has left them without a chance of being elected in our region."
TEX_radical_socialist_party:0 "Independent League"
TEX_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Independent League - An association aligned with the Social Patriots in the CSA, these radicals are aligned with radical farm groups and seek a class collaborative form of socialism."
TEX_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
TEX_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party - Most of the former progressive Republicans have ended up in the Progressive Party which ran before the Civil War. Without a national organ to draw from, the National Progressives are gradually absorbing them and making them a sub-wing of their organization."
TEX_social_liberal_party:0 "National Progressive Party"
TEX_social_liberal_party_long:0 "National Progressive Party - Part of the Republican Party has collapsed into the National Progressive Party, a creation of the Wisconsin-based La Follette family and one of the few major challengers to Long's agenda, with the party claiming to be more progressive than populist."
TEX_market_liberal_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The liberal democrats in the region desire a reunion with the pro-democratic factions of America at once if possible, only agreeing to work with the AUS to stop more radical factions. That said they do pay more lip service to farmers relative to other wings of the liberal democrats throughout the nation."
TEX_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party in the region that operates legally have often had to made concessions to populist rhetoric but in practice largely work with the AUS out of fear of the Old Democrats, non-local big business and Socialists. Supportive of segregation, their support would likely wane if lip service was paid to race progressives."
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The America First Party is a populist-American broad tent made up of those who follow a laborist, patriotic ideology and also generally view left socialism as being unpatriotic or totalitarian. They stand in opposition to other progressives by their reliance on political machines, their Share the Wealth Plan, relative cultural conservatism, populist-messaging, party militias and, more than anything, their personalism based around Louisiana Governor and firebrand Huey Long. As such they preach an odd mixture of radicalism, populism and pragmatism in order to enact a pro-labor and pro-farmer capitalist nation united around the American identity."
TEX_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The Radicals of the AFP view traditional voting as inadequate to the American people due to the influence of large corporations and banks, and believe a presidential dictatorship enveloped in populism would better represent the will of the American people."
TEX_national_populist_party:0 "White Leagues"
TEX_national_populist_party_long:0 "White Leagues - The various White Leagues in our territory are unorganized paramilitary organizations cut off the central apparatus of the National Democratic White League. While some have chosen not to take an official side during the war, the vast majority have sympathies with the CAR. Some AUS activists believe we could appeal to them to stop them from actively attacking us while others would rather see them finished."

TEX_liberal_AFP_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The Radicals of the AFP view traditional voting as inadequate to the American people due to the influence of large corporations and banks, and believe a presidential dictatorship enveloped in populism would better represent the will of the American people."
TEX_progressive_AFP_social_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_progressive_AFP_social_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is progressive-populism which defends and even seeks to enact further welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race moderation or progressivism in favor of strong civic nationalism."
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_liberal_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_liberal_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is liberal populism which defends and even seeks to enact further welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race moderation in favor of strong civic nationalism."
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_conservative_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_conservative_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is conservative populism which defends welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race conservatism."

TEX_christian_party:0 "Christian Party"
TEX_christian_party_long:0 "Christian Party - The official political-wing of the Silver Legion of America and a creation of William Dudley Pelley, the CP has largely absorbed both conservative populists and former democrats in the religious nationalist party. United by populist proposals of patriotism, universal employment and a minimum income for full citizens, the CP differs from the AFP and NPP in the emphasis on its military wing, Pelley's writings, harsher attitude towards socialism, citizen referendums, more explicitly Christian-based welfare, stricter constitutionalism, cultural supremacism (including overt anti-Semitism), and Pelley's ward policy towards groups of people he views as unproductive. As such the group is unsurprisingly extremely divisive even with the populist AUS, not helped by its even more radical-wing of the party being even more overtly racialist as well openly authoritarian, with many unsure how far Pelley would go to appease them."
TEX_christian_party_auth:0 "Christian Party"
TEX_christian_party_auth_long:0 "Christian Party - The official political-wing of the Silver Legion of America and a creation of William Dudley Pelley, the CP has largely absorbed both conservative populists and former democrats in the religious nationalist party.

TEX_texan_democrat_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_texan_democrat_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party, now a revitalized force under the leadership of Pappy O'Daniel, stands poised to rebuild the country from the ruins of war and economic depression alike. Texas has taken its rightful place as the leading American state, and its culture and values will surely have as profound of an impact on American culture as the Hillbilly Boys have in recent years. Though O'Daniel has his work set out for him, it seems that every American has heard the phrase "pass the biscuits, Pappy", a testament to his charisma and popularity. With the people behind him, O'Daniel will bring his vision to America."

TEX_political_chaos_idea:0 "Political Chaos"
TEX_political_chaos_idea_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Huey Long's demise, the country has been thrown into chaos. Several of his most trusted lieutenants and confidants are now vying for power in the post-Huey government, and until someone is able to fully consolidate power and stabilize the new government, we will suffer."
TEX_political_chaos_two_idea:0 "Improved Political Situation"
TEX_political_chaos_two_idea_desc:0 "While there is still work to be done to bring the fractured AFP, and the country, back together, we have taken the first steps towards that goal. Now we must continue our work on this front and bring order to the nation once more."
TEX_minor_support_idea:0 "AFP Unity"
TEX_minor_support_idea_desc:0 "In addition to our existing coalition, we have also won the support of smaller figures within the AFP, and with their help, we can govern the country effectively."
TEX_coughlin_support_idea:0 "Coughlin-Aligned Government"
TEX_coughlin_support_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to include Charles Coughlin in the new AFP coalition, and with his powerful following, we will have a more secure grip over the country."

TEX_smith_support_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to include Gerald L.K. Smith in the new AFP coalition, and with his charisma, we will have a more secure grip over the country."
TEX_earl_support_idea:0 "Earl-Aligned Government"
TEX_earl_support_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to include Earl Long in the new AFP coalition, and with his ties to Huey Long and irresistable charm, we will have a more secure grip over the country."
TEX_bingham_support_idea:0 "Bingham-Aligned Government"
TEX_bingham_support_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to include Alfred Mitchell Bingham in the new AFP coalition, and with his passionate following and industrial plans, we will have a more secure grip over the country."
TEX_insurgent_america_idea:0 "New American Spirit"
TEX_insurgent_america_idea_desc:0 "With America recovering from years of devastation, and now under the careful hand of Alfred Bingham, the country can now begin its journey towards a new prosperity; a new America. This will begin, of course, with construction and infrastructure."
TEX_dewey_plan_idea:0 "The Dewey Plan"
TEX_dewey_plan_idea:0 "The Dewey Plan, named after the legendary Bellamyist scholar, will aim to revolutionize education in the country. The main ideas of the plan are to make education into a more interactive affair, allowing students to participate in social reform given its new existence as a social instituion. Further, Dewey's emphasis on education as a place to learn not only knowledge but how to live makes it clear that education will be much more pragmatic for generations to come."
TEX_nationalized_healthcare_idea:0 "National Healthcare System"
TEX_nationalized_healthcare_idea_desc:0 "With the emergence and solidifcation of a national healthcare system, Bingham's plans for a new America are one step closer to fruition. Workers will now have much less to worry about in their daily lives, children can take care of their parents, and new families can be encouraged to replenish the country's population."
TEX_production_for_use_idea:0 "Production-For-Use"
TEX_production_for_use_idea_desc:0 "Production-For-Use is by far the most important part of Alfred Bingham's vision. An ideal society, one that understands that there are abundant resources for everyone, operates not out of profit but out of demand. Production must be driven by what people need, not by what can make the most money. As a result, we will save wasted resources and have a more efficient and satisfied populace."
TEX_no_speculation_idea:0 "Honest Economic Practices"
TEX_no_speculation_idea_desc:0 "Speculation is a practice that has plagued the American people for too long. To ensure that wealth is more democratically spread, as Bingham and the late Huey Long desired, we must eliminate the greedy practices of bankers and the wealthy once and for all. With more wealth in the hands of the middle class and the poor, we can create a more just and honest economy."
TEX_true_democracy_idea:0 "True Democracy"
TEX_true_democracy_idea_desc:0 "True liberty is the economic liberty that a worker enjoys under socialism. Industrial democracy, held up by a harmonious consensus of people living in abundance, must power our new society. However, while community will be strong, so too will the sense of personality that each person will enjoy in this society; with more time on their hands and a more equal living condition, our people can explore themselves to the fullest, and the country will prosper as a result."
TEX_middle_classes_idea:0 "The Middle Class Mind"
TEX_middle_classes_idea_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is not property that drives class; it is pscyhology. For revolution to succeed in America, it must be tailored to the middle classes, whose support is paramount to our continued rule. However, this is not limited to the economic middle classes, but instead to all those who consider themselves a member of the middle class, which is a significantly larger part of society. By taking advantage of this identification, and uniting labor and the economic middle class, we can lay the foundations for a radical organization of society."
TEX_outflanking_capitalists_idea:0 "Outflanking the Capitalists"
TEX_outflanking_capitalists_idea_desc:0 "The first major step in Bingham's economic transformation is to have a vertical cross section of the economy that is operated on a production for use basis. First, the unemployed will be brought into this system, but after a year, admittance will be voluntary. The resources of our nation will be leased to the government from factory owners and empty lands, and we will begin our experiment."
TEX_socialist_efficiency_idea:0 "Socialist Efficiency"
TEX_socialist_efficiency_idea_desc:0 "With the first steps taken towards our new economy, we can now expand it to the rest of the nation. Economic resources, now in the hands of the government, can be used more efficienctly for the prosperity of the country. With an increasingly planned economy, we will be more productive than ever before. However, we must take care to ensure we do not upset the middle classes we rely upon for support. As a result, we will not completely overhaul the economy, but the mere efficiency of our system will convince them to support it..." 
TEX_society_of_plenty_idea:0 "Societ of Plenty"
TEX_society_of_plenty_idea_desc:0 "In our new society, there is no hoarding of resources. Instead, we can enjoy the natural abundance of resources in the vast country we live in, and wealth, both in resources and otherwise, will flow through our population."
TEX_tactical_patriotism_idea:0 "Tactical Patriotism"
TEX_tactical_patriotism_idea_desc:0 "To appeal to the masses of Americans, we must appeal to their patriotic and nationalistic instincts. While this may not be ideal for us, it is no crime to have pride in one's country, and if we want a sustainable revolution, we must pre-empty any would-be nationalistic challengers from stealing our base of support from under our noses. If our people are fighting for their country, they will be all the more motivated towards our cause. However, this patriotism may be hard to control at first..."
TEX_tactical_patriotism_two_idea:0 "Lure Em' In"
TEX_tactical_patriotism_two_idea_desc:0 "Now that we have established ourselves as a truly patriotic government, we can use this perception to our advantage. By continuing to foster nationalism amongst the people, we can build a socialist movement that will bring the country that nationalists so desperately want, and without the fear of being overthrown. We will pay special attention to the military and entertainment, such as films and sports, to continue cultivating this weapon." 
TEX_uncorrupted_government_idea:0 "Honesty and Government" 
TEX_uncorrupted_government_idea_desc:0 "Though it may sound like a joke to some and an impossibility to others, we are confident that one of the first steps to restoring our nation should be to create an honest government. To the extent it is possible, we should try to eliminate big business influence in our politics, and ensure that government is of, for, and by the people. Huey Long had his faults, but his dream of a government that serves the people must be realized!"
TEX_american_families_idea:0 "The New American Family"
TEX_american_families_idea_desc:0 "To continue our reforms in America, we must emphasize the role of the family. The family is the unit which keeps the country stable, the glue that keeps it united. Without strong families, we would be left with little. Let us give subsidies to our families and support the replenishment of our population."
TEX_christian_support_idea:0 "Christian Support"
TEX_christian_support_idea_desc:0 "Though we are pious in our cause, we have sometimes struggled to gain the support of the church. Huey Long was never one to appreciate their potential, so now, we must court them ourselves. Faith will be paramount for building a new America, and we must ensure that the Bible is followed in the daily lives of every American, so that a moral America can emerge!"
TEX_currency_reform_idea:0 "Currency Reform"
TEX_currency_reform_idea_desc:0 "Though Huey Long started the process of currency reform, we must continue it. The old ideal of greenback currency, which the National Progressives espouse, would be an excellent start to this reform, although it is unknown what form it will take after that. For now though, we must protect our farmers from greedy bankers and investors, ensuring they will be safe to live normal lives once more."
TEX_virtuous_america_idea:0 "The New Republic"
TEX_virtuous_america_idea_desc:0 "America, as a republic, was founded on sound values, but lost its way after decades of corruption and incompetent administration. Now, with Huey Long beginning the work of reforming the country and our government continuing that work, we can have a virtuous republic once more. Democracy has been restored, and the people rejoice with their newfound power!"
TEX_chicago_plan_idea:0 "The Chicago Plan"
TEX_chicago_plan_idea_desc:0 "Originating from the University of Chicago, the Chicago Plan aims to separate monetary and credit functions within the banking system, with the goal of eliminating the danger of banks not being able to pay back all of their loans. Ideally, the banks would neither create money nor affect the money supply, and instead, money would be nationalized. This will stabilize our economy and hopefully help us recover from our recent economic woes."
TEX_press_freedom_idea:0 "Restore Press Freedoms"
TEX_press_freedom_idea_desc:0 "One of the longest traditions in our nation is the freedom of the press. Under Huey Long's wartime administration, these freedoms were curbed, but we must restore them if we are to continue his vision for America. After all, a friendly media could do wonders for our popularity..."
TEX_afp_machine_idea:0 "The AFP Machine"
TEX_afp_machine_idea_desc:0 "During Huey Long's life, he was able to establish a powerful Longist political machine to help him retain power. Now that he is dead, however, we have been forced to seize control of this wide operation, so that we could use it to our own advantage across the country. With the political machine firmly in our grasp, we will control the entire nation for years to come..."
TEX_media_help_idea:0 "Media to the Rescue!"
TEX_media_help_idea_desc:0 "For decades, the newspapers have been a source of consternatinon and relief alike for politicians anxiously waiting to see if their campaigns could win the hearts and minds of voters. Now, with the advent of the radio, the media is more important than ever. With their support, we can drown out any opponent, domestic or foreign. We must ensure our control of this institution, for if we control the media, we will control the nation as well."
TEX_finish_industrialists_idea:0 "Subservient Corporations"
TEX_finish_industrialists_idea_desc:0 "For too long, this country has suffered under the control of greedy industrialists. It was always Huey's dream to end their outsized influence in America, and we must finish what he started. By nationalizing major industries and taxing the richest among their numbers, the industrialists can be brought to heel and our control will be solidifed. Towards a new American economy!"
TEX_help_vets_idea:0 "Care for the Veterans"
TEX_help_vets_idea_desc:0 "Our veterans, the millions of men who have fought bravely for our side, must be taken care of. Huey Long certainly thought so; he never shied away from promising the veterans that they would be well compensated after the war, and would be among the first to see the realiziation of his vision of "Every Man a King". Now that he is gone, however, we must act on these promises. Through increased subsidies, homes, and more for our veterans, we can ensure stability and a happy population."
TEX_ending_poverty_idea:0 "An End to Poverty"
TEX_ending_poverty_idea_desc:0 "Perhaps the most important part of Huey Long's dream was the achievement of a country free from poverty. It would be a country where wealth was more fairly spread, where every man was a king in his own right. Though he perished before he had the time to see his vision to fruition, we have finished his work, and now, America stands strong once more. No longer shall we suffer the disease of poverty!"
TEX_earl_machine_idea:0 "Uncle Earl's Machine"
TEX_earl_machine_idea_desc:0 "Though Earl Long is Huey's brother and natural successor, his brother's political machine was by no means an easy thing to control, or acquire for that matter. Now that we have moved to secure it for Earl's cause, however, we are one step closer to securing our position as Huey's successor and the rightful government of the country. Now we just have to hold on to this machine..."
TEX_earl_machine_idea_2:0 "True Man of the People"
TEX_earl_machine_idea_2_desc:0 "Though Huey Long was famous for fighting for the people, it is in his brother Earl that the downtrodden American can find a true ally. Across the country, farmers, workers, and the homeless can all find a friend in Earl Long, who always preferred their company to that of perfumed politicians. His constant desire to be with his people has inspired new support for himself and his administration, and now we will reap the benefits of his charismatic, down-to-earth approach."
TEX_earl_machine_idea_3:0 "Loved by the People"
TEX_earl_machine_idea_3_desc:0 "Earl Long, now having built a name for himself and distinguishing himself from his older brother, can finally look with pride at what he has built. A political network; a network run by Earl and his closest allies, which now controls the nation. More importantly, though, Uncle Earl has ingratiated himself with the people, and with their resounding approval, can continue to fight for them as hard as they fought for him."
TEX_the_three_ps_idea:0 "Politicking, Plain People, and Pea Patch Farm"
TEX_the_three_ps_idea_desc:0 "Though he may come off as a simple but well-meaning politician to some, in reality, Earl Long is a master politician, rivaling his brother in his ability to whip up crowds and win supporters. Never one to enter political rivalries in the hopes of gaining the support of both sides, Earl Long has successfully navigated the vipers nest of the post-assassination government, and now can visit his beloved Pea Patch Farm in peace, mingling with hundreds of locals and travelers alike. His toil, both on his farm and for the country, has given us prosperity beyond our wildest dreams!"
TEX_retail_taxation_idea:0 "The Gas, Beer, and Retail Tax"
TEX_retail_taxation_idea_desc:0 "To help pay for some of our programs and to give our administration more funding for research purposes, we have decided to levy new taxes on gas, beer, and retail purchases. These may be unpopular at first, but at least our people will be better able to pay them..."
TEX_end_civil_service_idea:0 "End the Civil Service"
TEX_end_civil_service_idea_desc:0 "Since entrenched politicians nationwide, especially in the South, have given strong resistance to Earl Long and his reforms, Long has decided that he must take action. To strike the power of these politicians, he has declared an end to the Civil Service system, denying corrupt politicians their support base. Instead, patronage will be given from the president's office, and we will be all the more powerful because of it."
TEX_black_enfranchisement_idea:0 "Extend the Franchise"
TEX_black_enfranchisement_idea_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the First Civil War, many freed slaves hoped for the right to vote, and for a time, they enjoyed this right. However, the arrival of Jim Crow laws denied voting rights to African-Americans in large swaths of America, and now, this policy must end. Though Earl Long has often used the rhetoric of morality and liberalism on this issue, it is clear that the prospect of a new voting base also interests him, but who will complain?"
TEX_take_care_of_people_idea:0 "Food for the Needy"
TEX_take_care_of_people_idea_desc:0 "To gain further support amongst potential voters and to further Huey's vision of making "Every Man a King", Earl Long has decided to implement food programs to feed the poor and those in schools. This includes a free lunch program and efforts to ensure that the most impoverished parts of our country are at least somewhat fed. With that accomplished, we can look forward to a more productive workforce and a higher morale for our population overall." 
TEX_take_care_of_people_2_idea:0 "Better Hospital Care"
TEX_take_care_of_people_2_idea_desc:0 "To Earl Long, taking care of the people must involve giving them adequate hospital access when they are sick or injured. The state of hospitals in rural Louisiana, and the rest of rural America for that matter, is abysmal to say the least. With a focus on modernized hospitals, in rural areas and elsewhere, we can ensure that our people will at least be able to get the care they need. Though Huey Long perished from his assassination injuries, Earl Long reasons, the hospital he was taken to did its best to save him, and that should be the standard for anyone." 
TEX_christian_renewal_idea:0 "Fourth Great Awakening"
TEX_christian_renewal_idea_desc:0 "As part of his program to rebuild the country after the devastation it faced in the past decade, Gerald K. Smith hopes to create a Fourth Great Awakening in the country. Taking inspiration from the previous three movements, there will be a resurgence in Christians, particularly Protestants, as Americans remember the faith that once guided them through even the hardest of times. With their faith renewed, our people can begin to heal."
TEX_christian_renewal_2_idea:0 "Family Support Plan"
TEX_christian_renewal_2_idea_desc:0 "Families are the cornerstone of our nation, and though Huey Long did his best to support them, we must continue his work. Subsidies will be given to devastated families and couples, especially those of veterans and other loyal citizens, in the hopes that they will be encouraged to have more children."
TEX_christian_renewal_3_idea:0 "New Longist Disciples"
TEX_christian_renewal_3_idea_desc:0 "Though Gerald K. Smith loved Huey Long like few others could have, he believes it is crucial that we do not forget him. The younger generation, too young to understand Huey Long's message at the time and now growing up into a world without him, should be taught about his deeds, and we should ensure that Smith is viewed as the heir to his movement. With the support of this new Longist and Christian youth, we will create an America that would make Huey proud."
TEX_christian_renewal_4_idea:0 "American Morality"
TEX_christian_renewal_4_idea_desc:0 "Though Huey Long was of course right to see part of the source of America's rot in its greedy businessmen and inhumane treatment of the poor, part of the cause was also a decline in morality. Throughout the past decade, marriages and families alike declined, and crime racked the country. Now though, with Smith finishing the Share the Wealth vision of Huey Long, we have restored morality to the country once more."
TEX_smith_veterans_idea:0 "Smith's Veterans"
TEX_smith_veterans_idea_desc:0 "During the Civil War, Smith built a fierce reputation as a military leader, beloved by his men and feared by enemies on all sides. Now that the war is over, a large contingent of our veterans feel a sense of loyalty towards Smith. If the need arises, we will be able to call these men up once more to defend their country and Smith's movement. With their help, we will not be defeated!"
TEX_masses_propaganda_idea:0 "Propaganda for the Masses"
TEX_masses_propaganda_idea_desc:0 "With a reputation as perhaps the most charismatic man on Earth, Gerald K. Smith has decided to continue his rousing speeches to the people, reminiscent of Huey Long's old barnstorming speeches. The speeches are meant to gather more support for Smith's policies, increase his own popularity, and even inspire the people. Using the greatest tool at his disposal, Smith will bring America towards a new age of prosperity."
TEX_new_silver_idea:0 "Remonetized Silver"
TEX_new_silver_idea_desc:0 "In a bid to jumpstart the economy, continue Huey Long's policies, and shore up his own support, Charles Coughlin has declared the remonetization of silver. With a silver-backed currency, the economy will be more stable, allowing us to increase the money supply as needed. With these new resources, we can take care of all Americans."
TEX_new_silver_2_idea:0 "Tax Relief for the Poor"
TEX_new_silver_2_idea_desc:0 "Though Huey was right when he demanded the wealthy pay their fair share, we must give relief to the underprivileged parts of the country. It is the Christian thing to do, and it is an excellent political move as well: as long as we have the people on our side, we will be safe from threats inside and out. Further, Coughlin hopes that giving relief to the poor will allow them to spend this newfound money, and the economy will boom as a result. Taking care of our people is taking care of our country."
TEX_new_silver_3_idea:0 "Efficient and Honest Government"
TEX_new_silver_3_idea_desc:0 "A problem that Huey Long's government shared with the old government in Washington is that it was bloated and corrupt. We must streamline our day-to-day tasks and cut unnecessary programs, so that we operate a more responsible economy and country. If we can manage all of this, we will be one step closer to Coughlin's vision of what a true government should be."
TEX_new_silver_4_idea:0 "Liberty of Conscience"
TEX_new_silver_4_idea_desc:0 "Although the state has a large role to play in Coughlin's plans for America, it will not be allowed to overstep into people's lives. We must give our people the liberty of conscience that they live in a righteous and moral nation, a nation that will help them when they falter and leave them alone in prosperous times. We will follow the principles of Social Justice and ensure that all can follow their chosen avocation in life."
TEX_wealth_conscription_idea:0 "Wealth Conscription"
TEX_wealth_conscription_idea_desc:0 "In these times of crisis, we must enact a conscription of wealth on the nation. The wealthy must contribute to the defense and the rebuilding of the nation from its smoldering ruins, and through our new wealth, we can afford many necessities that would be out of our reach otherwise. New research can be conducted, resources gained, logistics secured, and with these factors, we will have a stronger nation than ever before!"
TEX_national_sermons_idea:0 "National Sermons"
TEX_national_sermons_idea_desc:0 "Before Coughlin was ever in power, he gave radio speeches to his nationwide audience, with millions listening to his political rants. Now that we hold power and legitimacy, we can use this radio history to our advantage. Coughlin will continue to sermonize on the radio, making the case for his policies and acting as a moral guide for our people. The radio is a powerful tool at Coughlin's disposal, and he will use it wisely."
TEX_our_economy_idea:0 "Our Economy"
TEX_our_economy_idea_desc:0 "Now that we have broken the financial slavery we suffered under various shadowy financiers, we can use our economy as we see fit. New factories and resources are now fully under our control, and keeping with his usual rhetoric, Coughlin promises a more efficient economy than ever before!"
TEX_christian_capitalism_idea:0 "Christian Capitalism"
TEX_christian_capitalism_idea_desc:0 "Though Capitalism must be reformed, the most important thing is ensuring that the true principles of Christianity are followed. We will care for the poor, and though Capitalism will still exist, the wealthy will be strongly encouraged to engage in philanthropic practices. By keeping a careful eye on the corporations and ensuring the people are moral and happy, we can get our economy back on track."
TEX_exalt_humble_idea:0 "Protect the Humble"
TEX_exalt_humble_idea_desc:0 "Many of our people still face poverty in the aftermath of the destructive Civil War. To combat this, we must emphasize them as the group that we will legislate for, and by uplifting the humblest among us, we will uplift the entire nation. Though we are focused on the poor, we will take care to not target the wealthy too much, but they will pay their fair share. With everyone pitching in, we will move forward into a new age."
TEX_punish_wealth_idea:0 "Punish Greed"
TEX_punish_wealth_idea_desc:0 "If our reforms are to succeed, we must break the power of monopolists and industrialists once and for all. These are the same groups that fought against Huey Long's reforms, and with their wealth, we will be able to benefit the entire nation. This is a fact that the wealthy are unable to grasp; their focus on the short-term blinds them. We must punish them for their short-sightedness and greed and ensure that America is a nation for all its people, not just those at the top."
TEX_ban_unions_idea:0 "Hardworking Americans"
TEX_ban_unions_idea_desc:0 "Rather than having our people join unions, we will place an emphasis on hard work over all else. America has always been known for its work ethic, and to complete the vision of Huey Long, we must utilize this quality."
TEX_loyal_unions_idea:0 "Loyal Laborers"
TEX_loyal_unions_idea_desc:0 "The important thing in the conflict between capital and labor is loyalty. With industrialists weakened already, we should now turn to the unions, and ensure their loyalty. During the Civil War, many of these unions sided with the CSA, but those that sided with Huey Long are now among the most powerful in the country. Their loyal support means that we do not have to worry about factory sabotage or inefficient work; the unions will do their work, as negotiated, and we will be all the better for it."
TEX_subsidized_unions_idea:0 "Subsidize the Workers"
TEX_subsidized_unions_idea_desc:0 "A happy worker is a productive one, and to ensure our workers are happy, we must make their voices heard. Through an official endorsement and subsidization of unions, our government can bring them firmly to our side, while simultaneously making sure they are powerful enough to challenge corporations."

TEX_Devers_plan2:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan2_desc:0 "The first step in Devers's plan to reform the military is to take a tally of the officers deserving of promotion for heroism and those deserving of demotion for wasteful actions. Those deserving will be recalled to the capital to meet with our new suppliers."
TEX_Devers_plan3:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan3_desc:0 "The second step for Devers is to assess the state of the forts and weapon stocks scattered across the country. Equipment that is in need of repair or is deemed too dangerous will be removed and recycled."
TEX_Devers_plan4:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan4_desc:0 "With the officers now informed and our weapons stocked, it is time for Devers to arrange the order of battle around the national strategy. This may dissapoint generals who enjoyed abusing their authority to make risky manoeuvres, but this is progress."
TEX_Devers_plan5:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan5_desc:0 "With Devers' reforms finished, our army now stands at the forefront of military tactics and organization, with an expanded logistical service and the latest in force weaponry, we will be able to respond to any threat, no matter how many enemys they send after us."
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea:0 "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Plan"
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_desc:0 "The first part of Terrible Terry's plan involves him taking more direct control of our military. This will likely have the result of improving our battle performance, given that Terry is a tactical genius. Some argue that his tactics are outdated, but we cannot deny their effectiveness so far."
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_2:0 "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Plan"`
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_2_desc:0 "The next step in the Terrible Terry plan is concerned with organizing our troops further. Specifically, he hopes to emphasize cavalry. This will allow us to plan better against our enemy, and see what they are planning before we arrive on the battlefield."
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_3:0 "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Plan"
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_3_desc:0 "Terrible Terry does not want to repeat the predictability of Weltkrieg generals. He prefers his enemies to know as little about his tactics as possible, and in the pursuit of that goal, has aimed for an unpredictable strategy. Such a strategy has several benefits for our troops. With an emphasis on speed and unpredictability, we will be unstoppable in the field." 
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_4:0 "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Plan"
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_4_desc:0 "Night Assaults are a crucial part of the Terrible Terry plan. With this element of surprise, we can overcome our enemy with secret plans and better training, especially if they are too exhaused to fight back."

TEX_lighning_joe_idea_4_desc:0 "If our artillery can be coordinated with other areas of our army, and with each other, we can have a much more effective means of bombarding our enemy. We should work to ensure that this is the case, for our explosive power may just win us this war."

TEX_lighning_joe_idea_5_desc:0 "Lightning Joe believes we should concentrate our firepower on certain sections of the enemy forces, so that we can punch holes where they are weakest and sap their strength where they are strongest.

TEX_unite_afp_decisions_desc:0 "With Huey Long out of the picture, the AFP has become fractured, with a multitude of factions aiming to take over. If we want to heal the wounds inflicted by Huey's demise, we must work towards reconciliation with some of these factions."
TEX_reconcile_coughlin:0 "Reconcile with Coughlin"
TEX_reconcile_coughlin_desc:0 "Charles Coughlin has always had strained relations with [TEX.GetLeader], but this relationship has only worsened in recent weeks. With a powerful radio show and an intimidating following, Coughlin has never been the closest Huey Long confidant, instead more or less operating his own faction within the party. This has caused Coughlin some problems, and most of all, he has faced accusations of disloyalty. Regardless though, he wields a significant power base, and we would be wise to offer concessions in the form of a watered-down version of his 'Social Justice' plan."
TEX_reconcile_smith:0 "Reconcile with Smith"
TEX_reconcile_smith_desc:0 "Gerald L.K. Smith has sharply criticized [TEX.GetLeader] in the aftermath of Huey's demise, and most of our advisors speculate that this is because he expected to succeed his idol and lead the country in what he believes is Huey's vision. Others attribute his abrasiveness to a fear of being sidelined on the national political stage. Whatever the case may be, Smith is one of the most charismatic men in the country, and bringing him to our side would benefit us much more than eliminating him from politics altogether. However, Gerald L.K. Smith is not an easily tamed man, and to win his supoprt, we will have to offer certain concessions, ranging from farmer subsidies to going after groups Smith alledges were involved in Huey's assassination."
TEX_reconcile_earl:0 "Reconcile with Earl Long"
TEX_reconcile_earl_desc:0 "Earl Long, lovingly dubbed 'Uncle Earl' by his nephew and his supporters, is no fan of [TEX.GetLeader], a fact he has made clear in rousing speeches following Huey's demise. Though he had a mixed relationship with his brother, Earl insists that he now represents the interests of the Long family, and winning his support could mean a certain degree of legitimacy in the eyes of many. Further, Uncle Earl brings some talents of his own; he is a captivating storyteller, and an excellent orator beyond that. Most of all though, hidden behind his veneer of plainness, he is a shrewd political actor. We would do well to have his sharp mind on our side, before another group wins his loyalty."
TEX_reconcile_bingham:0 "Reconcile with Bingham"
TEX_reconcile_bingham_desc:0 "Alfred Mitchell Bingham leads a peculiar group, ranging from Bellamyists to Socialists to Technocrats, and everything in between. Whatever their preferred labels may be, however, none are too fond of [TEX.GetLeader], and this is not surprising. After all, their fringe wing of the AFP is rarely represented in party affairs, and we have done little to change that. However, if we wanted to seek out their support, we could give certain concessions in the form of leniency for some of the more left-wing traitors in the former CSA and PSA. Further, they would want us to continue what Huey started in public ownership of industries, going beyond his plans for it, or perhaps to act on healthcare and once and for all establish a national insurance system."

TEX_new_washington_desc:0 "Huey Long has done it! Populists, who have been sneered at or even ignored since their birth in Kansas, now reign supreme in the country. It is thanks to our new Washington, Huey Long, that this could be achieved. With Long at the helm, nothing is beyond our reach. We shall overcome poverty and make America the nation it was always meant to be. Every man a king!"
TEX_to_the_victor:0 "To the Victor"
TEX_to_the_victor_desc:0 "It is over. The enemies of the American People have been felled and we control their lands.

TEX_root_out_out_traitors:0 "Root out Traitors"
TEX_root_out_out_traitors_desc:0 "Despite their armies being defeated, extremists still populate the American states we have brought justice to. We need to root out those whom will never be satisfied with democracy under Huey Long, namely the militant cells that threaten the American populace at every turn."
TEX_reconcile_the_left:0 "Reconcile the Left"
TEX_reconcile_the_left_desc:0 "We can never excuse the CSA's attempt to overthrow the American Constitution or their embrace of anti-American syndicalism, but the grievances of the workers that were fooled into supporting them are fair. We should appeal to the Independent Leagues and AFL, whom desire economic reform. We know they wanted to work with Huey even before the war, but the most extreme radicals made a ceasefire the best offer we could provide. We will now bleed support from these same radicals."
TEX_afp_alone:0 "AFP Alone"
TEX_afp_alone_desc:0 "Compromise. That was the word used by useless politicians who nearly handed our country over to extremists. The AFP and the nation more generally is not going to go out of its way to appeal to any of the factions that aligned themselves against the American Union State. If they so wish, let them repent and embrace Longist values on their own, but we will not compromise."
TEX_reconcile_the_right:0 "Reconcile the Right"
TEX_reconcile_the_right_desc:0 "There is no mistake that the political right made mistakes in supporting either the Feds or Murray. However their pro-American values and defense of capitalism against syndicalism is admirable. Besides, their machines are too large to hit head on. Instead, we should co-opt them with appeals to the cultural conservativism and anti-socialist populism, opening the way to taking the South."
TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats:0 "Dismantle the Dixiecrats"
TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats_desc:0 "The right-wing Democrats have looked down on Huey Long since he was a lawyer defending the little man from corporations. Now they wish for us to allow their machines to thrive, despite their attempts on the Kingfish's life. Let's see if they are so smug when the radical DWL gets a taste of their own medicine and the regressive Southern machine is wholly replaced by a progressive one."
TEX_black_support:0 "Black Support"
TEX_black_support_desc:0 "With our desire to displace the Old Democrats in their entirety, we have gained a more positive reputation with the country's black population. While Huey has long been ambigious on Civil Rights issues, he has suddenly found himself more vocally supporting increased spending on black communities at the expense of the landed elites of the South, leading to a rapid increase in black AFP supporters."
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie:0 "Shake Hands with Dixie"
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie_desc:0 "The Old Democrats are finished on a national scale, but their machine in the South remains. The Union made a terrible and costly mistake in bothering to oppose it after the Civil War, one we should not repeat. While we will hunt down the irreconciable White Leagers, we should cut a deal with the Southern Democrats whom now look to us for protection, promising not to uproot them so long as they do not oppose Long."
TEX_a_new_solid_south:0 "A New Solid South"
TEX_a_new_solid_south_desc:0 "The Southern Democratic machine lost the war and as a result learned its place under Long. They are already making appeals to support him on the national level if allowed to maintain their machines in the South and given some autonomy. So long as they weed out radical anti-Longists and pay their share, there is no need to further disrupt the South. They are now a reliable voting block and White League opposition is winding down."

TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Members of Congress have devised a way to establish a baseline of trust in our democratic system, which is sorely needed.

TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyalty"
TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The Fish Act's critics rightfully stated that there was no incentive for officials to sign the affidavits.

TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "Executive orders have been used to create agencies to serve the American people in the past, so long as it does not intrude into state sovereignty.

TEX_townsend_plan:0 "Townsend Plan"
TEX_townsend_plan_desc:0 "Francis Townsend's plan for ending old age poverty via a generous pension scheme has long been part of Long's platform and will now be enacted.

TEX_share_the_wealth:0 "Share the Wealth"
TEX_share_the_wealth_desc:0 "It has come time for the rich that helped plunge America into civil war to pay. No person will be allowed to accumulate more than 300 times the annual national income.

TEX_imperial_presidency:0 "Imperial Presidency"
TEX_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "With traitors uprooted and exposed, public opinion polls now show overwhelming support for President Long's re-election. Unrestrained by pressure to conform or be threatened by members within the AFP, the president has begun what many are calling his 'imperial presidency'.

TEX_fire_with_fire:0 "Fight Fire with Fire"
TEX_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "The ideological fight against the political and social enemies of America has been done thus far with welfare and incentives.

TEX_commodity_controls:0 "Commodity Controls"
TEX_commodity_controls_desc:0 "The farmers of this nation have been squeezed for too long, despite their goods fueling the rest of America!

It will start with nationalizing utility companies that took an anti-AUS stance and purchasing agricultural goods."
TEX_farm_subsidies:0 "Farm Subsidies"

TEX_scientific_board:0 "Scientific Board"
TEX_scientific_board_desc:0 "The Farmer-Labor Political Federation and the AFP shall enter a symbiotic relationship in embracing scientific planning for basic utilities and commodities while rejecting the radicals desire to do this for other goods.

TEX_coops_plan_desc:0 "A popular concept in both wings of the AFP, farm coops allow for farmers to share their resources with one another.

TEX_radical_economics:0 "Labor Economics"

TEX_banks_for_america_desc:0 "It is long past time to adopt the Popular Control Plan for banking! A Central Bank will be created that will have control over the banking industry, with a board of directors directly elected by the people.

### Pelley Path ###
TEX_christian_party_victory:0 "Christian Party Victory"
TEX_christian_party_victory_desc:0 "In an outcome that has shocked both the nation and onlookers abroad, Huey Long and the America First Party have lost the first elections in America since the conclusion of the civil war. William Dudley Pelley, chairman of the Christian Party and Chief of the Silver Legion, has won both a slim majority in congress and secured the highest office in the land."
TEX_defend_democracy:0 "Defend Democracy"
TEX_defend_democracy_desc:0 "Before his election, the President was called many things. A legionnaire, a syndicalist, a populist tyrant, and so much more. Yet he has always claimed to be dedicated to upholding the American republic and the values on which it was founded. We shall implement a judicial bill that will affirm our committment to trial by jury and the powers of the court, and increase penalties for corruption."
TEX_organize_new_elections:0 "Organize New Elections"
TEX_organize_new_elections_desc:0 "Despite the steady rebuilding of our great nation, some express concern that the AFP was more concerned with its own power than with restoring America. In a bid both to distance ourselves from Long and increase our own popularity it has been decided that the federal government will ensure proper oversight for all state-level elections and remove those who won their seats through legally dubious methods."
TEX_fight_the_terrorists:0 "Fight the Terrorists"
TEX_fight_the_terrorists_desc:0 "Despite the end of the civil war, fighting has not entirely ceased. Ideologues still cling to their beliefs and occasionally strike at us before slinking back into the shadows. President Pelley shall order law enforcement to begin a nationwide crackdown to root out these murderers. Further, the Silver Legion will be deployed to supplement their efforts. America is no place for cowardly traitors!"
TEX_reform_the_fbi:0 "Reform the FBI"
TEX_reform_the_fbi_desc:0 "It was inevitable that government agencies like the FBI would be shattered by the civil war. Despite their hostility to Pelley in the 1930’s the President sees the need and utility of such an organization. Once freed from the grip of Hoover and his gang of sycophants and given proper oversight, they will help ensure the wellbeing of the republic and the upholding of our great laws!"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism:0 "Outlaw Syndicalism"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism_desc:0 "The SPA’s attempt to destroy our nation has cemented President Pelley's suspicions that these traitors cannot be allowed to legally spread their filth. Effective immediately, all Marxist, Syndicalist, Bolshevist, and other vocal revolutionary left groups will be considered seditious and effectively outlawed. Some may complain that this is deeply authoritarian, but sometimes such measures are needed."
TEX_political_rehabilitation:0 "Political Rehabilitation"
TEX_political_rehabilitation_desc:0 "Despite the inherent evil of their leaders, do we not see that the average syndicalist is simply a man who wishes to have bread on his table? Thus we will direct the Department of Justice to begin drafting lists of currently imprisoned (non-leading) radicals and offer them clemency in return for a renunciation of their former beliefs and a written statement to never again support such causes."
TEX_national_command_structure:0 "National Command Structure"
TEX_national_command_structure_desc:0 "Despite our recent political success, infighting is abundant within the Legion. Local commanders complain of inconsistent orders, accountants skim off the top, and desertion is increasingly commonplace. This is unacceptable and damaging, not only to the Legion, but to America as a whole. The President will call a meeting of top Silver Legionaries to formalize a better command system."
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety:0 "Build Silver Lodges"
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety_desc:0 "The Silver Lodges were a grand idea devised by Pelley and his top commanders before the Civil War. The idea would involve the Legion purchasing lands on which to build command centers, in-order to facilitate recruitment. With many Lodges destroyed in the fighting, we should further our commitment to the Legion and direct the treasury to allocate funds to units so that they may build new headquarters."
TEX_wrangle_congress:0 "Wrangle Congress"
TEX_wrangle_congress_desc:0 "Despite the Christian Party having won the election, President Pelley has still found our politicians to be a bickering and gridlocked sort. Whilst his legislation does pass, it often takes too much time and requires far too much politicking for Pelley's liking. The solution to this is clear; utilize the radio as our new platform and decry those shysters who would hold up America’s future for their petty games."
TEX_pdol:0 "Expand the Department of Labor"
TEX_pdol_desc:0 "Pelley gained most of his following from his radical economic proposals and the time has come to begin implementing these grand ideas. This monumental effort will begin with a vast expansion of the Department of Labor: in each and every county across our nation, a DoL office will be opened. This will set the groundwork for a truly staggering effort to transform the American economy."
TEX_universal_jobs_registry:0 "Universal Jobs Registry"
TEX_universal_jobs_registry_desc:0 "With the DoL properly expanded, in each county a grand registry of each business and every possible position will be compiled and paired with a list of every worker in that county. The work will be commprehensive, to say the least. The DoL will use this combination to ensure that every American can easily and quickly find work, and when a worker cannot find work in one county, the offices will cooperate and attempt to find jobs for all who need them."
TEX_the_silver_rangers:0 "Expand the Silver Rangers"
TEX_the_silver_rangers_desc:0 "The Silver Rangers are the law enforcement group of the Silver Legion. They work to ensure that dues are paid, regulations are upheld, and that the demeanor of the Legion is in line with what the Chief and President desires. Our government is growing more popular by the day, and it has become apparent that they will need a recruitment drive of their own, lest our whole organization implode in on itself."
TEX_christian_commonwealth:0 "The Christian Commonwealth"
TEX_christian_commonwealth_desc:0 "The time has come for Pelley’s most grand idea to be put into motion. The Christian Commonwealth is a vast overhaul of the entire American economy into a hybrid system. In this system, private businesses can still exist, but they will all be subservient to and part of the Commonwealth Corporation. Furthermore all banks will be absorbed into a Central Treasury Bank which will be responsible for distributing credit."
TEX_annual_dividends:0 "Annual Dividends"
TEX_annual_dividends_desc:0 "With the Commonwealth system coming together the next ambitious step must be taken. In every county, a Treasury Bank will be opened and every native-born or naturalized American given an identification number and bank checkbook. From this moment forward, every American will be guaranteed an annual number of credits to ensure that none of our countrymen shall be subjected to the deepest depths of poverty."
TEX_gallahad_fellowship:0 "Galahad Fellowship"
TEX_gallahad_fellowship_desc:0 "Pelley's original Galahad College taught a wide variety of topics, including Christian economics, esotericism and Pelley’s Liberation Doctrine, which has since grown into Soulcraft. While the college closed during the civil war, Pelley has declared the time has come not only for Galahad College to be re-opened, but for the Galahad Fellowship to be formed and sister schools to be opened nationwide."
TEX_universal_education:0 "Universal Education"
TEX_universal_education_desc:0 "Is it not imperative for a society that the next generation be well educated? The President certainly believes so. Pelley has introduced measures to guarantee that every American youth will be granted (depending on the student) either a college scholarship or enrollment in a trade school. The youth will praise our names and future generations will be better equipped to carry on our grand experiment."
TEX_referendum_voting:0 "Referendum Voting"
TEX_referendum_voting_desc:0 "It is time to introduce the CP's proposed reforms to the legislative system. Firstly, we shall allow voters to eject their congressman if they believe they have alienated their constituents. Next, we shall implement a final step in the legislative process where all congressional legislation must require the majority approval of voters it would impact."
TEX_a_better_america:0 "A Better America"
TEX_a_better_america_desc:0 "Though many feared what would become of America under our rule, we have achieved greatness. Every American has a stable income from the Commonwealth, our democracy has been expanded, and Christian values have been restored to their rightful place. To complete out goals we shall fully integrate the so-called "Wards" into the Commonwealth and re-introduce the traditional American Bill of Rights."
### La Follette Path ###

TEX_legacy_of_fighting_bob:0 "Venerating Fighting Bob"
TEX_legacy_of_fighting_bob_desc:0 "Bob LaFollette was the original inspiration for the National Progressive Party and supported the foundation of both Progressive Parties. We will pass the LaFollette Bill in his name which will guarantee workers the right to unionize without fear of being fired."
TEX_peace_not_war:0 "People over Arms"
TEX_peace_not_war_desc:0 "Ensuring that the military growth we've seen in the past couple years would not destroy the Republic was one of our promises. It results in needless war and more MacArthurs, and we will see to it that this does not occur. We will shift current military spending to civilian contracts and our future education programs, for our governments stands for peace, not war."
TEX_wisconsin_idea:0 "The Wisconsin Idea"
TEX_wisconsin_idea_desc:0 "The ideal of all men being educated was a dream held by the Founding Fathers, but now it can be a reality. We will follow the Wisconsin Model and, after expanding current schools, fund higher education and trade schools so it costs next-to-nothing for qualified citizens to enter higher education."
TEX_modernized_congress:0 "Modernized Congress"
TEX_modernized_congress_desc:0 "Congress can not hope to stay up with the nation if it never modernizes itself. We should update this institution so that the bitter arguments and inaction of recent times will be a relic of the past."
TEX_farmer_labor_alliance:0 "Farmer-Labor Organization"
TEX_farmer_labor_alliance_desc:0 "We must organize rural and urban workers so that they may intermingle, share mutual aid, and have a shared political lobby. We will campaign for more to join the Farmer-Labor Party and collaborate closely with it."
TEX_proportional_representation:0 "Proportional Representation"
TEX_proportional_representation_desc:0 "An idea long supported by Progressives such as George Norris and Bob La Follette, the first-past-the-post system of voting is badly outdated and encourages party corruption and machines. Proportional Representation must be campaigned for in each state, and the constitution will need to be reformed for such a voting system. This will occur when enough support is gathered, of course."
TEX_granger_coops:0 "The National Grange"
TEX_granger_coops_desc:0 "The National Grange is an honorable American institution that allows the rich and poor to mingle in rural communities and for the former to aid the latter. Encouraging rural mutual aid and farm support, we will have census employees help farmers register for the Grange and give it a grant to expand it."
TEX_plumb_plan:0 "The Plumb Plan"
TEX_plumb_plan_desc:0 "Named for Glenn E. Plumb's plan for cooperative railroads on a national level, the government will sell bonds and use them to purchase railroads. These will be combined in a single public corporation, partially run by the government. The workers and management shall run it in equal measure, and 50% of the profits will go to the workers."
TEX_private_public_planning:0 "Private-Public Planning"
TEX_private_public_planning_desc:0 "The expansion of government planning need not imply overriding private citizens. We will hire a wide range of government planners and contractors who will work with citizens and local councils to help them build ideal housing and local projects."
TEX_empowered_executive:0 "Empowered Executive"
TEX_empowered_executive_desc:0 "The presidency must be able to respond to crises with more vigor if the recent disasters the United States suffered are any example. The President will be given more leniency on economic executive orders, so that they may overcome an inefficient Congress when the need arises."
TEX_democratic_safeguards:0 "Democratic Safeguards"
TEX_democratic_safeguards_desc:0 "Simply because the President has more power does not make him a MacArthurite. Transpareny in government is absolutely neccessary, so we will allow reporters to more easily enter Congress and empower the Judiciary Branch. We shall keep our democracy safe!"
TEX_modern_farms:0 "Modern Farms"
TEX_modern_farms_desc:0 "Farms were devastated by the war, yes, but they were already collapsing before that point. They must be updated with modern instruments and crops. We will supply farmers with the best seeds available and purchase additional farm equipment for them. Further, new technology will increase their yield."
TEX_national_infrastructure_plan:0 "National Infrastructure Plan"
TEX_national_infrastructure_plan_desc:0 "It's time to make a mass effort towards not only rebuilding, but improving our infrastructure. A mass infrastructure plan will begin with a national infrstructure plan that is friendly to locals and will contract small business owners to do the work wherever possible."
TEX_sewer_socialism:0 "Sewer Socialism"
TEX_sewer_socialism_desc:0 "Our cities desperately need a rework of their power and water. We will invest in building the neccessary infrastructure demanded by cities, including a mass effort to update their electricity and public health systems. Our cities shall be clean once and for all."
TEX_public_lands:0 "Public Lands"
TEX_public_lands_desc:0 "One of our most important environmental ideas involves the idea of greater public lands. This will allow the federal government control over areas that can be turned into national parks, monuments, and most importantly, government projects."
TEX_greenback_currency:0 "Greenback Currency"
TEX_greenback_currency_desc:0 "The only result of past governmental obsession with stomping out inflation was to reward the lender class and further impoverish those in debts, such as farmers. The Greenback Currency will be named for the old populist party idea and will not be tied to the gold standard. With its introduction, we will create a small amount of inflation to help those in debt."
### Texas Path ###
TEX_pappy_odaniel:0 "Pappy O'Daniel"
TEX_pappy_odaniel_desc:0 "W. Lee O'Daniel, the most prominent Democrats in Texas, is now in control of the entire American Union State. His administration is almost certain to increase the influence of Texas within the government, but he promises to represent the entirety of America during his time in power. His charismatic radio speeches and calls for prayer have inspired millions, and now we will see what this outsider does with real power..."
TEX_five_point_plan:0 "Five Point Plan"
TEX_five_point_plan_desc:0 "To counter the calls for a "Share the Wealth" plan, O'Daniel has decided to create his own "Five Point Plan". The plan will involve raising millions in new revenue, banning deficit spending, abolishing unnecessary taxes, abolishing capital punishment, and of course, appointing a state-audited budget director. O'Daniel hopes this plan will win the hearts of minds of his people, but there is much work to be done to implement these proposals..."
TEX_texas_values:0 "Texas Values"
TEX_texas_values_desc:0 "From the founding of the American Union State, farmers across the Great Plains have shared influence with Huey Long's Louisiana allies, and yet Texas has not garnered the power it deserves. Now, this will change, and Texas will take its rightful place at the head of the Union State cause, moderating Long's radical proposals with homemade Texas populism, toughness, and religiosity."
TEX_old_age_pensions:0 "Old-Age Pensions"
TEX_old_age_pensions_desc:0 "One area where Huey Long was undoubtedly right was on old-age pensions. O'Daniel made this one of his foremost promises, and he intends to follow through on it. However, since he is unwilling to engage in deficit spending and reluctant to raise taxes, we must find some way to raise the funds for this proposal."
TEX_industrialization_committee:0 "Industrialization Committees"
TEX_industrialization_committee_desc:0 "The Great Plains as a whole are perhaps the least industrialized region of America. If we want these states to have a place, if we want farmers and ranchers to have a voice, we must pursue industrialization. Further, through industrialization, we can bring desperately-needed investment into the country, investment that can help us get back on our feet after the Civil War. For a new America!"
TEX_soil_conservation_act:0 "Soil Conservation Act"
TEX_soil_conservation_act_desc:0 "One of the greatest tragedies of recent times was the Dust Bowl, which devastated our farmers and ranchers and drove millions into despair. This act will hopefully work against soil erosion and by proxy, prevent further environmental devastation from wind and other forces. With this act, we will never suffer another Dust Bowl."
TEX_fight_wasteful_spending:0 "Fight Wasteful Spending"
TEX_fight_wasteful_spending_desc:0 "Some of W. Lee O'Daniel's largest foes in Texas were those who promised their constituents money one way or another but then spent it elsewhere, either to enrich themselves or otherwise pursue their own interests. In fact, O'Daniel believes a significant amount of government spending is nothing more than corruption, and it is rarely used to truly benefit the common man. We must change this, and make spending a more economical, and representative, affair."  
TEX_slice_taxes:0 "Slice Taxes"
TEX_slice_taxes_desc:0 "Pappy O'Daniel ran on cutting poll taxes and taxes overall, with the idea being to ease pressure on everyday Americans and give them more spending power. Just like in Texas however, this proposal has been met with opposition nationally by other factions of the American Union State. We must reassure them by finding other ways to pay for our programs..." 
TEX_radio_showmanship:0 "Radio Showmanship"
TEX_radio_showmanship_desc:0 "From his early days in the Flour industry, O'Daniel has used the radio to great effect. Through the radio, he has reached a larger audience than ever before, and this audience now clamors to hear his reassuring speeches in even the darkest of days. Even better, O'Daniel has also managed to use his radio following as a political weapon against those who wish to block his agenda."
TEX_reconcile_big_business:0 "Reconcile Big Business"
TEX_reconcile_big_business_desc:0 "Originally, the American Union State did not have much industry, suffering from geography and populist rhetoric that businessmen viewed as being against them. However, O'Daniel believes populism and business can work together, and this is exactly what he plans to do. With more supporters in this community, we can truly compete with our rivals and ensure prosperity after the Civil War."
TEX_labor_agitators:0 "Labor Agitators"
TEX_labor_agitators_desc:0 "The time has come to fight the outsiders who have been brought into our towns and cities to agitate among honest union men. Union organizations and outside infiltrators turn citizens who are trying to make a living into vicious revolutionaries. If we do not counteract this threat immediately, everything we have fought for will perish."
TEX_sunday_broadcasts:0 "Sunday Broadcasts"
TEX_sunday_broadcasts_desc:0 "To help increase morale and his own support, O'Daniel wishes to hold Sunday broadcasts after Church that will further convey a religious and patriotic message to all our citizens. In these times, such a message is needed more than ever, and we cannot forget who we are as a nation. Perhaps we can even bring the disparate political factions of the Union State to our side."
TEX_ten_commandments:0 "The Ten Commandments"
TEX_ten_commandments_desc:0 "One of the parts of O'Daniel's platform that separated him from his opponents was his emphasis on the Ten Commandments. These rules, and the Golden Rule, have informed Pappy O'Daniel's approach to politics. Now, we must ensure they also inform the daily lives of citizens and soldiers alike, and good God-fearing Americans will populate the country once more."
TEX_hillbilly_boys:0 "The Hillbilly Boys"
TEX_hillbilly_boys_desc:0 "Pappy O'Daniel's ability to entertain audiences in-person and on the radio with his bands was something that helped him catapult to the national stage. The most useful group in this endeavor was his "Hillybilly Boys" band. With their help in concerts and on the radio, thousands learned of O'Daniel and his message to save America. Now, perhaps it is time to repay them for their assistance, but how?"
TEX_power_to_farmers:0 "Power to Farmers"
TEX_power_to_farmers_desc:0 "It was once the case that the everyday American was a farmer who took care of his crops and did his best to serve his country. That image is gone today, and as a result, America has lost its identity. We must do what we can to empower the downtrodden Western farmer in this country: it is the only way we will ever recover from our present crises."
TEX_obligations_to_our_children:0 "Obligations to our Children"
TEX_obligations_to_our_children_desc:0 "For years, politicians have promised much needed funding for schools, teachers, and orphans, and yet these corrupt officials never followed through on their promises. We must do right by God and by our people, and give these groups the funding they were promised. O'Daniel may be against new funding, but as far as he is concerned, a promise made is a promise kept."
TEX_oil_boom:0 "National Oil Boom"
TEX_oil_boom_desc:0 "Thanks to our new industry and the ongoing discovery of oil in Texas and elsewhere in the country, we are experiencing a boom in oil production. This new resource will bring us prosperity, but more importantly, it may be a stable source of funding for O'Daniel's programs, assuming we impose a small tax on oil and gas. The businesses will surely not mind, given the sheer profits they have enjoyed lately, and our people will rejoice."
TEX_protect_poor_whites:0 "Protect Poor Whites"
TEX_protect_poor_whites_desc:0 "The poor White man has been left behind in recent years, with the government acting instead in the interests of businessmen or immigrants. If we take care to protect the poorest among us through charity and other means, we will build a stronger nation as a whole. The common White man will prosper as never before!"
TEX_beautiful_america:0 "Beautiful America"
TEX_beautiful_america_desc:0 "This land of the free, established by our ancestors, will be made beautiful once more under the leadership of Pappy O'Daniel. We are proud of our poorest farmers and workers, and no matter where an American lives, they will live in the most beautiful country we know."

### Huey Successors ###
TEX_the_longist_legacy:0 "The Next Step"
TEX_the_longist_legacy_desc:0 "Huey Long is gone! Now, we must take swift action to consolidate our power in the country. To do this, we will have to outwit our rivals and win the hearts and minds of the same people that committed themselves to Huey's cause. Though the future is unclear, America demands that we step up to fill his shoes."
TEX_national_crusade:0 "National Crusade"
TEX_national_crusade_desc:0 "Gerald L. K. Smith, the firebrand who idolized Huey Long, has come to power, and must now bring his own program of reform to the nation. Through a mix of Huey's policies and his own ideas centered around his faith, Smith hopes to earn the respect of Huey's close associates and the American people, people he has always respected, but who have never respected him."
TEX_christian_renewal:0 "Christian Renewal"
TEX_christian_renewal_desc:0 "Our country went astray when it forgot the Christian values that had brought it to the status of a world power to begin with. If Americans can bring themselves to faith once more, we will put our country on the road to prosperity. Even better, Smith is confident that this plan is exactly what Huey would have wanted, despite him being led astray by cosmopolitan advisors."
TEX_support_for_families:0 "Support for Families"
TEX_support_for_families_desc:0 "The family is perhaps the most important social unit in world history. In America, however, families have been desecrated by years of war, famine, and suffering. If we want to heal the wounds of recent decades and finish what Huey Long started, we must support American families, and promote their growth. We must heal our battered population and create a new generation of Americans!"
TEX_protect_farmers:0 "Protect Farmers"
TEX_protect_farmers_desc:0 "Farmers were hit harder than almost anyone during the Great Depression, and many of them threw their lot in with Huey Long during the Civil War. Now, we should pay them back for their loyalty. To do this, we must ensure their prices and land are protected, and whether they are in Louisiana, Iowa, or any other state, the American farmer will have reason to be proud once more."
TEX_train_new_disciples:0 "Train New Disciples"
TEX_train_new_disciples_desc:0 "Gerald K. Smith's personal fans are nothing compared to the likes of Huey Long or Charles Coughlin, and it is time that we made our own image. To do this, we will win the next generation over to both the Longist agenda and our own. With this solid base of support, we can ensure the success of our reforms for decades to come."
TEX_smiths_veterans:0 "Smith's Veterans"
TEX_smiths_veterans_desc:0 "During the Civil War, Smith was responsible for riling up our soldiers and pushing for an aggressive, moralistic strategy in the war. Now that he is in charge, he wants to continue to have the support of the brave men who fought for him. Through increased pensions and bills targeted towards veterans, we can ensure their loyalty and raise the morale of our troops."
TEX_new_american_morality:0 "American Morality"
TEX_new_american_morality_desc:0 "Though we fell short in recent times, a new sense of morality has been created in the country. Families grow once more, workers do their best for the nation, and even our children insist on doing their part on creating an America based more on the Christian virtues the nation was founded on than the corruption of recent years."
TEX_friends_in_high_places:0 "Friends in High Places"
TEX_friends_in_high_places_desc:0 "To secure our place in power, we must first bring allies to our side. Seeking out friends in high places is no easy task, but through bribes, maneuvering, and old-fashioned elbow grease, we can find the support we need to bring our following up to par with our rivals."
TEX_reveal_the_treachery:0 "Reveal the Treachery"
TEX_reveal_the_treachery_desc:0 "The demise of Huey Long was brought about not by himself or rival political forces, but by greedy bankers and foreigners who have no love for this country or what it has created. We must reveal the true nature of these traitors if we are to secure vengeance for the wrongs committed against the entire country in recent decades."
TEX_prosthelytize_to_the_masses:0 "Prosthelytize to the Masses"
TEX_prosthelytize_to_the_masses_desc:0 "The people are Gerald K. Smith's greatest weapon, and he is no stranger to this fact. By making our case to large crowds, Smith believes he can win them over to his cause, and secure his place as Huey's rightful successor in the eyes of millions. By soothing the unsure population, we can bring them back on track, and win a nation over through words."
TEX_cast_down_the_wicked:0 "Cast Down the Wicked"
TEX_cast_down_the_wicked_desc:0 "The sinners who tried to undermine our movement must be punished. Huey Long did not understand their duplicity, and that was his downfall. Smith will not allow that mistake to happen again. To avenge Huey and so many others who have fallen victim to the viciously wicked among us, we must uproot their power, once and for all."
TEX_christianity_and_capitalism:0 "Christianity and Capitalism"
TEX_christianity_and_capitalism_desc:0 "Christianity and Capitalism are not incompatible; in fact, they can work in tandem. With the support of businessmen and the church, we will have significant power behind us, and we can use these forces to promote a new America based not on greed but on the values in the Bible."
TEX_exalt_the_humble:0 "Exalt the Humble"
TEX_exalt_the_humble_desc:0 "The poor, the humble, the downtrodden; they go by many names, but one thing remains the same: these people are suffering. For their heroic work in day-to-day life, they should be rewarded. Though we will not overstep and try to destroy big businesses in America, we should make it clear whose side we are on, and try to achieve compromises that are acceptable to all."
TEX_punish_the_wealthy:0 "Punish the Wealthy"
TEX_punish_the_wealthy_desc:0 "The greedy monopolists and businessmen have gotten away with robbery for too long! To create a truly fair America, we must punish them for their sins, and firmly take a stance at the side of the nation's workers."
TEX_outlaw_unions:0 "Outlaw Unions"
TEX_outlaw_unions_desc:0 "Unions are a parasitic institution, a fact demonstrated in the CSA during the Civil War. Now, they hope to take over our government as well, and all the while leech off our funds while depriving virtuous workers of a job. We must ban these institutions if we want our economy to thrive, and without their traitorous interference, we will thrive."
TEX_loyalty_in_labor:0 "Loyalty in Labor"
TEX_loyalty_in_labor_desc:0 "It is important for a nation to have strong unions; after all, they are the only way for workers to have a say. On the other hand though, we must ensure these unions are loyal to us and us alone if they are to be given prominence in our economy. With the unions on our side, we can help to rein in haughty corporations and businessmen, and ensure a fair balance between capital and labor, once and for all."
TEX_subsidize_unions:0 "Subsidize Unions"
TEX_subsidize_unions_desc:0 "Unions are paragons of workers rights, and we must not forget this fact. Any man who claims to be an ally of the American worker must support unions. No, we will not support unions who fought for the CSA or others, but we will not shy away from endorsing and funding those unions that have proven their loyalty time and again. With strong unions, the workers of this country will have a strong voice, as they should."
TEX_defend_private_property:0 "Defend Private Property"
TEX_defend_private_property_desc:0 "The principle of private property is one of the founding ideals of this country. All citizens are entitled to privacy within their own property, and though we have enlarged the size of our government, it does not mean we should trample on this fundamental right. Instead, we will make sure that every man is a king, especially on his own land."
TEX_meek_inherit_earth:0 "The Meek Inherit the Earth"
TEX_meek_inherit_earth_desc:0 "The working people of America, a class that could be considered as 'meek' due to their relative poverty, must be defended, according to the Bible. After all, it is the meek that will inherit the earth, and if we secure lands for these groups, we will be all the more righteous. Though the wealthy will complain about their land being taken, they will soon understand that it is for the best of all involved."
TEX_arcadian_america:0 "Arcadian America"
TEX_arcadian_america_desc:0 "The natural beauty of this country, as well as the brilliance of our founding principles and Huey's plans alike, must guide us in this next phase of American life. We will be the envy of the world, as we were always meant to be, and all we had to do was follow the wise guidance of the founders and Huey Long."
TEX_social_justice:0 "Social Justice"
TEX_social_justice_desc:0 "Charles Coughlin has taken power at the head of a popular movement, hoping to implement his plan of 'Social Justice'. For Coughlin, this means a patriotic plan to gain workers rights, reform the currency, and drive out the money changers. He is not a close Long associate, but if can win over enough support with his plans, it will matter little."
TEX_national_sermons:0 "National Sermons"
TEX_national_sermons_desc:0 "Through his old radio speeches, Charles Coughlin gained a massive following. Now that he is in power, something must be done to reassure the people of the administration's success in fighting for them. Coughlin himself is determined to take to the radio, giving speeches on policy and other issues that are more akin to sermons than political oratory, but regardless, we will make our cause all the more popular."
TEX_the_christian_front:0 "The Christian Front"
TEX_the_christian_front_desc:0 "The Christian Front is an association of conservative Longists who have aligned themselves with Charles Coughlin. We must grow this organization, and with the help of Coughlin's newspaper Social Justice, perhaps it will grow to truly massive proportions. Though some whisper that they are more focused on perceived enemies than helping the common man, it is vital that we encourage the growth of The Christian Front. "
TEX_pursue_the_financiers:0 "Pursue the Financiers"
TEX_pursue_the_financiers_desc:0 "Though they tried to cover up their deceit, we know who the true enemies are. The bankers and money changers have swindled our people for too long, and it is time we made a concerted effort to deprive them of their power, once and for all."
TEX_break_financial_slavery:0 "Break Financial Slavery"
TEX_break_financial_slavery_desc:0 "For too long, we have been slaves to those who run our economy. An economy of the American people cannot be owned by a few un-American traitors. With the banks and the national economy now under our power, we are in a position to break the financial slavery we have suffered under for so long, and we can create a truly free America."
TEX_remonetize_silver:0 "Remonetize Silver"
TEX_remonetize_silver_desc:0 "Silver was always a better standard than Gold. William Jennings Bryan knew it, Huey Long knew it, and we know it as well. The first part of Coughlin's economic reforms is to remonetize silver, and therefore allow an increase to the money supply. It is a risky policy, but we must at least try it if we hope to create a new vibrant economy."
TEX_wider_nationalization:0 "Wider Nationalization"
TEX_wider_nationalization_desc:0 "Huey Long's nationalization of industries did not go far enough; we must do more. By nationalizing instutitions such as banks, oil, railroads, and more, we can ensure that our government is never short of the resources it needs to take care of the people. Though some traitors will protest this supposed breach of freedom, we will remind them that they have no right to control the American people, and that we are their true representatives."
TEX_tax_relief_for_poor:0 "Tax Relief for the Poor"
TEX_tax_relief_for_poor_desc:0 "Though we have been somewhat harsh on our wealthier citizens, we must spare the poor from any burdensome policies that might cause a spiral into despair-or death. Instead, we will give tax relief to these downtrodden segments of society, and hopefully this will inspire them towards greater spending and participation in the economy."
TEX_wealth_conscription:0 "Wealth Conscription"
TEX_wealth_conscription_desc:0 "In times of crisis, wealth must be conscripted just as men might be. For those who hoard the wealth and resources of our nation, Coughlin requests only a patriotic share of their vast fortunes. After all, if we are all Americans, we must all contribute equally. If the rich want to weasal out of fighting, they must contribute in other ways."
TEX_simplified_government:0 "Simplified Government"
TEX_simplified_government_desc:0 "Government works best when it is simple. The bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that some called the American government in recent times was an example of what we should not do. Instead, we will streamline government institutions and ensure that government is simple, as any government of, for, and by the people should be."
TEX_liberty_of_conscience:0 "Liberty of Conscience"
TEX_liberty_of_conscience_desc:0 "Among the oldest freedoms in our nation are the ability to practice any religion or follow any avocation in life. The government must not trample on these rights, and through a continued guarantee of them, we can have a true liberty of conscience in America."
TEX_an_unlikely_successor:0 "An Unlikely Successor"
TEX_an_unlikely_successor_desc:0 "Against all odds, we now control the nation, and we now have large shoes to fill. Tough choices must be made; will we follow the path set forth for us by Huey Long, and if so, can we emulate his success with the American people? Only time will tell, but for now, we must create at least a semblance of stability."
TEX_solidify_position:0 "Solidify Our Position"
TEX_solidify_position_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our place as Huey's successor, it is time to stabilize the nation. Though Huey was the 'Imperial President', we have no such legitimacy, and as such, we will seek to create it, one way or another."
TEX_make_voting_machines_sing:0 "Make the Voting Machines Sing"
TEX_make_voting_machines_sing_desc:0 "Those who count the votes in the country are the ones who control the nation in reality. By gaining control over these groups, we will have dominance for decades to come, and our policies and plans will be enshrined in the American psyche."
TEX_honor_huey_long:0 "Honor Huey Long"
TEX_honor_huey_long_desc:0 "The great founder of our new nation, Huey Long, is no longer at the helm of the country. Now that we have succeeded him, we should take care to honor him and further his legacy. More importantly, honoring Huey Long will help us solidify our position as the heirs to the Longist movement, and gain us significant support with our people."
TEX_media_propaganda:0 "Media Propaganda"
TEX_media_propaganda_desc:0 "The newspapers were a critical institution in the old America, having the ability to end political careers on a whim. If we want to maintain power, we must first gain their support. This will happen in a two-fold way: those who are favorable to us will be coerced to support the government agenda, and those who do not will find themselves in a world of pain."
TEX_veterans_bill:0 "Veterans Bill"
TEX_veterans_bill_desc:0 "The veterans who fought for the American Union State must be honored, especially since control over the military is so important to our own power. By passing a landmark 'Veterans Bill', we can guarantee their loyalty for years to come and show the people that we respect those who sacrifice the most for our cause."
TEX_finish_industrialists:0 "Finish the Industrialists"
TEX_finish_industrialists_desc:0 "The overmighty industrialists who once ruled this nation are on the run, and we must finish them off. No longer will they have undue influence over America; while they can still exist, they will never dominate the government again. By sweeping the rug from under them, the industrialists, loyal or not, will no longer have the power to control our economy, and all Americans will be better off."
TEX_eliminate_poverty:0 "Eliminate Poverty"
TEX_eliminate_poverty_desc:0 "Poverty is like a plague on American life. For our existence, it has been unrelenting, always creeping into the lives of our poorest citizens. This will no longer be the case, and with careful measures to ensure an end to staggering wealth inequality, we will finally wipe out this disease."
TEX_democratic_transition:0 "Democratic Transition"
TEX_democratic_transition_desc:0 "Now that Huey Long is gone, we must continue his work of reforming the country and establishing a healthy democracy. One hurdle to this will be in deciding how we will lead the AFP moving forward, and what policies we pursue. Regardless, however, all Americans can rest easy in the knowledge that their government will now work for them."
TEX_honest_government:0 "Honest Government"
TEX_honest_government_desc:0 "One of the biggest factors that drove the nation to civil war was a lack of trust in the corrupt government. The people were right to be wary; the government was, after all, taking advantage of them and serving only a small group of interests. Now, we will ensure that the government can be held accountable to those it is meant to serve: the people."
TEX_rural_schools:0 "Rural Schools"
TEX_rural_schools_desc:0 "Huey Long planned to invest more in new schools, especially for the rural areas that need them so badly, after the war. However, now that we are in power, we must bring this plan to fruition. By building better primary schools and perhaps even universities in the rural areas of our nation, we can better educate the next generation, and also help those areas recover."
TEX_chicago_plan:0 "The Chicago Plan"
TEX_chicago_plan_desc:0 "The Chicago Plan was originally drafted by the University of Chicago, and endorsed by AFP politician Bronson Cutting. The plan would see banks separate their monetary and credit functions, creating a full-reserve banking system. In practice, this would make it so that banks have enough money to cover their loans. Further, as Irving Fisher has put it, it would "nationalize money, but not banking"."
TEX_new_american_family:0 "The New American Family"
TEX_new_american_family_desc:0 "A task we must pursue if we want to create prosperity in America is supporting our families. The American family has been devastated in the past twenty years, and if we are successful in promoting their growth once more, we will have a growing population-and a larger pool of manpower to draw from."
TEX_currency_reform:0 "Currency Reform"
TEX_currency_reform_desc:0 "Huey Long understood that the currency needed some sort of reform if it were to function efficienctly and fairly. We will act on this issue and make sure it is not the incompetent banks who handle this part of the economy, but us, and that perhaps a silver currency will be adopted rather than a gold one."
TEX_roll_back_censorship:0 "Roll Back Censorship"
TEX_roll_back_censorship_desc:0 "During the Civil War, Huey Long instituted certain policies of censorship on media and other institutions that were understandable at the time, but must now be rolled back. To have the newspapers on our side, we should show them that we will give them plenty of space to conduct their business as they see fit. With freedom of the press reinstated, we are one step closer to creating a new America."
TEX_reconcile_the_church:0 "Reconcile the Church"
TEX_reconcile_the_church_desc:0 "It is well known that Huey Long did not have the best relationship with churches, despite the best efforts of men like Gerald K. Smith and Charles Coughlin. Regardless, now that we are in power, we should make an effort to extend an olive branch to these organizations. We should not hope for direct endorsements, but if we can get them to sympathize with us at least, it will show that we truly are good Americans and only wish to bring some semblance of morality back to America."
TEX_a_virtuous_republic:0 "A Virtuous Republic"
TEX_a_virtuous_republic_desc:0 "A republic free of corruption is what the people call out for, and it is what they deserve.

TEX_the_people_yes:0 "The People, Yes"
TEX_the_people_yes_desc:0 "The populist vision for America, in which the hard-working common man is able to make a good living for himself and his family and all share in the prosperity of the nation, has finally come to fruition. We have brought changes into a world resenting change, and now, the tough will of the American people has paid off."
TEX_uncle_earl:0 "Uncle Earl"
TEX_uncle_earl_desc:0 "Earl Long, the estranged brother of the legendary Huey Long, has come to power, succeeding his brother and continuing what some are calling the Long Dynasty. Despite his familial ties to Huey, Earl has a lot to prove, and even if he does prove a worthy successor to Huey, he must make a choice: will he follow in Huey's footsteps, or implement his own vision for the country?"

TEX_fulfill_his_vision_desc:0 "Earl Long has decided that he must continue the work of his brother, a man he often agreed with, despite their tendency to argue with one another. In establishing what some are calling a "Long Dynasty", Earl has reassured worried onlookers that he hopes to finish Huey's plans and govern for as long as the people wish, though just how long that will be is yet to be seen."
TEX_world_class_highways:0 "World-Class Highways"
TEX_world_class_highways_desc:0 "Part of Earl Long's program to bring the country back from economic ruin is the building of a new national highway system. Plans for such a system have been in the works for years, but now we have the resources to finally make good on our promises. This will allow us to connect our vast nation like never before."
TEX_retail_taxes:0 "Retail Taxes"
TEX_retail_taxes_desc:0 "Earl Long is a practical man, and he understands that to pay for Huey's programs, we must implement higher taxation in some cases. For this purpose, it is proposed that a retail tax, as well as small taxes on gas, beer, and more, would give more than enough for these programs. It may be unpopular, but it will allow us more funding for important advances in research as well as our domestic programs for the people."
TEX_louisiana_politicking:0 "Louisiana Politicking"
TEX_louisiana_politicking_desc:0 "Despite seeing himself as Huey's natural heir, Earl Long still has many enemies. To eliminate or otherwise undermine these rivals, he wishes to engage in a what he calls "a little Louisiana politicking". This will involve challenging rivals with favorable candidates, denying party financial support to naysayers, and using the bully pulpit to keep dissenting politicians in line. Earl Long is a master at such strategies, and through his crafty maneuvering, we will have a stable AFP."
TEX_end_civil_service:0 "End the Civil Service" 
TEX_end_civil_service_desc:0 "The Civil Service makes life difficult for Earl Long. How could he accomplish his goals if he cannot fund the politicians responsibe for voting? Instead of this system, we will encourage patronage, given by Earl Long chiefly but by allies as well, which will allow us greater control over politicians nationwide. Though some decry this as a blatantly tyrannical move, Earl has swatted such criticisms aside, noting that the politicians deserve it anyways."
TEX_the_earl_of_louisiana:0 "The Earl of Louisiana"
TEX_the_earl_of_louisiana_desc:0 "As the master of a resurgent America, Earl Long has achieved a status on par with his brother. His towering figure and warm charisma have led some to dub him the 'Earl of Louisiana', given his seemingly unshakable grip on the nation's government. For better or worse, Earl Long is firmly in the saddle."
TEX_distract_public:0 "Distract the Public"
TEX_distract_public_desc:0 "The public is a fickle thing, and if we want their support, we have to give them distractions. Like the Roman saying of 'bread and circuses', we will ensure our people are focused on entertainment and other things so that we have free reign to implement our plans. Further, through rousing speeches, Earl Long himself will have the people in his hands, and this will surely enhance his popularity."
TEX_secure_the_long_machine:0 "Secure the Long Machine"
TEX_secure_the_long_machine_desc:0 "Huey Long's machine was never opened to Earl Long before the Civil War, and it is something that Earl bitterly remembers. Now that he is in power though, we must seize the machine for ourselves, to help ensure we maintain power for as long as we need to and to ensure nobody else gets their hands on it. Though he had to wait his turn, Earl Long can finally take his rightful place at the head of the Long family and its powerful political machine."
TEX_plenty_of_snap_in_my_garters:0 "Plenty of Snap in my Garters"
TEX_plenty_of_snap_in_my_garters_desc:0 "Given his smaller reputation and tendency to spend time with the downtrodden rather than Huey's old practice of dividing his time among all economic classes, some have said Earl is unworthy to succeed Huey Long. Some even say that Earl lacks the vision or ambition that his brother had. For those in doubt, though, Earl Long only has one thing to say: "I've got plenty of snap left in my garters!"."
TEX_charm_the_people:0 "Charm the People"
TEX_charm_the_people_desc:0 "An Earl Long speech is not an event, it is an experience. Crowds of tens of thousands come to see his colorful oratory and his humorous anecdotes, and though his speeches are not very policy-focused, the people love them anyways. Through barnstorming the country and doing his beloved work of connecting with common people, Earl will win them over to his cause."
TEX_three_ps:0 "The Three P's"
TEX_three_ps_desc:0 "Politicking, Plain People, and Pea Patch Farm; these are the things most important to Earl Long. A mastermind political actor as well as a lover of farmers and other average workers, Earl Long would much rather spend his time with voters and supporters on his farm than engage with perfumed politicians in an office. Though he has ambitious plans to reform the nation even now, sometimes it is best to enjoy the simpler things."
TEX_a_new_direction:0 "A New Direction"
TEX_a_new_direction_desc:0 "Rather than closely following his brother's plans, Earl Long has decided to move forward with his own plan of reforms. Though it is similar in many ways to Huey's vision, Earl notes that his plan takes a firm stance on race, and does more to engage with the working people of America. After all, what better way is there to win new voters?"
TEX_black_enfranchisement:0 "Black Enfranchisement"
TEX_black_enfranchisement_desc:0 "The issue of the Black vote has been a taboo in the South for decades, but now that the Civil War is over and Earl Long is in control, it must be readressed. We will ensure that people of all races, especially Blacks, will be able to vote if they choose to do so, and hopefully, they will choose to vote for us in gratitude."
TEX_feed_the_hungry:0 "Feed the Hungry"
TEX_feed_the_hungry_desc:0 "Though blatant starvation is rare in America, there is still a large part of the population that is underfed, particularly children. By ensuring that workers have the money they need to feed their families and that children have access to free lunches at school, we can ensure our people focus on other matters besides their growling stomachs."
TEX_equal_teachers_pay:0 "Equal Teachers Pay"
TEX_equal_teachers_pay_desc:0 "America's teachers have received dismal treatment as of late, and they have never been paid as much as they are worth. Never one to turn away a possible vote, Earl Long has decided that it is necessary to increase teacher's salaries, and ensure that there is no discrimination on the basis of gender. Experienced teachers will be paid more, but with this discrimination largely out of the way, our families will do better as a whole."
TEX_modern_hospitals:0 "Modern Hospitals"
TEX_modern_hospitals_desc:0 "Our hospitals are in need of modern equipment and technology, and Earl Long is happy to provide whatever they need. Modernizing urban hospitals, building new ones in rural areas, and overall ensuring that the sick always have somewhere they can be taken care of, Earl hopes that we can take care of all our veterans and anyone else harmed by the Civil War. We will take care of our people, and they will take care of us."
TEX_rock_em_sock_em:0 "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em"
TEX_rock_em_sock_em_desc:0 "Uncle Earl is seen by many to be a tireless man, but when questioned on his superhuman stamina, he merely stated that he engages in "Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em" politics, and stated that if his rivals didn't like it, they should go somewhere else. His criss-crossing of the country has made him a star in the eyes of millions, and his engaging and often humorous speeches are more popular than ever."
TEX_american_radicalism:0 "American Radicalism"
TEX_american_radicalism_desc:0 "The oddball Alfred Bingham and his movement for American Radicalism have taken power in the country. Though they do not follow Huey Long's agenda closely, they purport to be his intellectual successors, and insist that their policies will fulfill his goals. The middle-class radical hopes to win over the American people, but first he must decide what policies are most important to him."
TEX_the_middle_class_mind:0 "The Middle Class Mind"
TEX_the_middle_class_mind_desc:0 "To create a revolution in a bourgeois nation, we must engage with the middle class mind. The middle class is ready for a classless society, and Bingham believes the average American does more to act like someone in a commune than a rugged individualist. By tailoring our rhetoric to this class, making sure we do not offend their wealtheir sensibilities, we can create something truly revolutionary in the nation."
TEX_tactical_realism:0 "Tactical Realism"
TEX_tactical_realism_desc:0 "To bring the American people to our side, we must make small changes to the economy. This way, few will be upset at what are largely seen as modest reforms, though they will be a complete overhaul of the economy over time. One step at a time, we will chip away at the old system, as Huey Long did, and create a new, better economy."
TEX_outflank_capitalism:0 "Outflank Capitalism"
TEX_outflank_capitalism_desc:0 "Capitalism is still popular with a majority of Americans, and to undermine it, we should demonstrate its dysfunction as a system. To do this, we will repurpose old factories and take over a vertical cross-section of the economy, operating it on the production-for-use basis rather than the old profit system. This is merely a test, but we believe the people will react well to it."
TEX_lure_them_in:0 "Lure Them In"
TEX_lure_them_in_desc:0 "We are not deaf to the concerns of the American people. Though they are concerned about economics, they yearn for patriotic appeals too, and if we hope to keep their support, we must take advantage of this. By painting our movement as uniquely American in nature and rousing up feelings of nationalism, we can speed up our reforms and prevent other rival groups from using that rhetoric for their own purposes."
TEX_socialist_efficiency:0 "Socialist Efficiency"
TEX_socialist_efficiency_desc:0 "Now that we have begun the reformation of the economy, it is time to show the American people that the socialist system we envision is more efficient. We will slowly but surely transition our economy to a socialist model, nationalizing major industries and outflanking the old industrialist class."
TEX_society_of_plenty:0 "Society of Plenty"
TEX_society_of_plenty_desc:0 "America is a nation of vast resources, and yet until recently, they were concentrated in the hands of a few. Now, there will be a more equal distribution, and in a new society of plenty, all will prosper. No longer will our resources be thrown away for profit motives; we will use them in the interests of the everyday American, and we shall be the powerhouse we were always meant to be."
TEX_common_sense:0 "Common Sense"
TEX_common_sense_desc:0 "Drawing on the rhetoric of Thomas Paine and other American thinkers, Alfred Bingham created the monthly journal of the same name. Now that he is in power, Common Sense has become the most popular journal in the country, and Bingham has decided to use it to help promote his ideas to those who have never considered them before. With crucial media support, we can continue advancing towards a new nation."
TEX_insurgent_americans:0 "Insurgent Americans"
TEX_insurgent_americans_desc:0 "In a recent book by Alfred Bingham, in which he dubbed the American people as 'insurgent Americans', it was said that the American people cry out for change. It is true, and with Bingham as their leader, the American people will finally get a more equitable system, a system in which fairness rules the day and greed has been driven from our shores. America has risen up!"
TEX_rehabilitate_leftist_radicals:0 "Rehabilitate Leftist Radicals"
TEX_rehabilitate_leftist_radicals_desc:0 "Bingham understands that our movement pales in comparison to the likes of Huey Long's following, and so, we should make some attempt to rehabilitate leftist radicals from other Civil War factions. From Upton Sinclair to Thomas Dewey, we will do our best to help these fellow radicals understand that we are not their enemies, and in some cases, we will reunite with long-lost allies to build a larger socialist movement than ever."
TEX_peace_in_the_west:0 "Peace in the West"
TEX_peace_in_the_west_desc:0 "On the West Coast, Upton Sinclair's EPIC plan is still a commonly known proposal in the minds of many. It has relevance for us too, for the EPIC plan inspired much of Bingham's own policies, particularly in attacking capitalism by outflanking it, rather than fighting it directly. With the hopes that we can charm Sinclair to our side, we will be able to win another portion of America's radicals to our side."
TEX_assimilate_the_bellamyists:0 "Assimilate the Bellamyists"
TEX_assimilate_the_bellamyists_desc:0 "The Bellamyists in the CSA were our allies; though they sided with a different faction, this was done to attempt to influence as many sides as possible. Now that the country is united once more, we should reunite with the likes of Thomas Dewey, who is an old friend of Bingham's. It is likely that they could be persuaded to join us, and with them on our side, we will be all the more stronger."
TEX_production_for_use:0 "Production for Use"
TEX_production_for_use_desc:0 "For centuries, America has operated on a production for profit system. Resources have been wasted, the people have suffered, and all of it for what, a Civil War? Bingham has a new vision, a vision of a society in which products are made on the basis of use, not profit, and in doing so, we will create a more just and equitable society. We will create a simultaneously more efficient and humane economy that takes care of all Americans, and we will be the envy of the world."
TEX_national_insurance_system:0 "National Insurance System"
TEX_national_insurance_system_desc:0 "In continuing Huey Long's reforms and pushing for his own, Bingham has decided that a national insurance system is needed. For example, this will guarantee that any American can go to a hospital if they are sick and injured, and show the world that a country that takes care of its people will be a prosperous one. The mafia-like insurance companies will never terrorize Americans again!"
TEX_abolish_speculation:0 "Abolish Speculation"
TEX_abolish_speculation_desc:0 "The damaging practice of speculation, once done in banks and financial institutions all over America, must end. We cannot allow banks to play with people's money; instead, they should focus on their other responsabilities, as they always should have."
TEX_solidify_public_ownership:0 "Solidify Public Ownership"
TEX_solidify_public_ownership_desc:0 "The national ownership of public utilities such as water, electricity, railroads, and more, must be assured. By finishing what Huey started in giving the ownership of these tools to the people, we will create a nation in which profit is not the driving force. Through this, we will continue on the road to a truly production-for-use society."
TEX_technology_and_technocracy:0 "Technology and Technocracy"
TEX_technology_and_technocracy_desc:0 "Though Bingham is not purely a technocrat, he does admit that they have certain useful ideas. The ideals of a futuristic nation in which experts can run the government are appealing, and we should seek to promote the type of world envisioned by thinkers such as Edward Bellamy, among others."
TEX_true_democracy:0 "True Democracy"
TEX_true_democracy_desc:0 "Now that we have created a nation that is not only politically democratic, but democratic in the workplace and the economy overall, we can finally say with pride that we live in a democratic nation. It is not the old false democracy of capitalism, but instead, a comprehensive democratic system, in which all people can take part."
TEX_visionary_from_prospect_hill:0 "The Visionary from Prospect Hill"
TEX_visionary_from_prospect_hill_desc:0 "From his beginnings in Prospect Hill, Alfred Bingham has had a long and harrowing journey. Influeneced by mostly American thought, as well as some foreign thought, he has created an America that he is proud of, an America in which a middle class revolution has manifested. Finally, we can move forward as a classless society and enjoy prosperity for years to come."

### Reconstruction ###
TEX_rebuilding_the_country:0 "Rebuilding the Country"
TEX_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "A long struggle to push through the Federalist, Syndicalist, and ODP forces in America has left the victorious Union State economically drained. The hand that unifies the country can either promote a deficit spending regime, or an austere policy that limits direct intervention in the market."
TEX_national_recovery:0 "National Recovery Administration"
TEX_national_recovery_desc:0 "The NRA emphasizes the use of public domain and work-living units instead of 'cut throat competition' of regular contract work. Workers in the NRA will receive the benefit of a minimum wages and price-controlled work environments in constant to the old Company Store model."
TEX_public_works:0 "Public Works Administration"
TEX_public_works_desc:0 "The ability to generate electricity, transport water, and ensure safe and efficient travel was lost during the civil war. However, the Public Works Administration will fix all that. It is a fund that will ensure contractors pay their employees fairly, so that their are better incentivized to help rebuild."
TEX_research_projects:0 "National Education Administration"
TEX_research_projects_desc:0 "In the wake of the collapse of the CSA, the National Education Association has folded and its members have dispersed. With most teachers being apolitical and the union never being able to exert much partisan power over them, it is a strong candidate for rehabilitation by the new American government."
TEX_civil_works_adminstration:0 "National Public Works"
TEX_civil_works_adminstration_desc:0 "As a nation, America lost a great deal of its labor supply to the fighting and poverty of recent years. The leader has pushed an executive order authorizing the creation of an agency to employ manual laborers to fill out the spaces in employment for NRA projects."
TEX_the_ccc:0 "National Valley Authority"
TEX_the_ccc_desc:0 "The damage done to America by the civil war has been considerable, and even approaching the idea of reconstruction seems like an insurmountable problem. An idea has been floating around the capital of establishing a public body to oversee not only the reconstruction effort but looking into how to rebuild a better America once that project is complete."
TEX_rural_electrification:0 "Rural Electrification"
TEX_rural_electrification_desc:0 "The electricity network throughout the country has regressed to that of the 1910s. This is un-American and we need to ensure that our constituents can be properly informed about our nation's glory. Further, electrification will give our rural areas access to much "

TEX_the_aaa:0 "Farm Relief"
TEX_the_aaa_desc:0 "Farms are the basis of the American economy, but they have seen devestation wrought from the Civil War. Only through a combination of direct farm aid via lump cash payouts to compensate for damaged equipment, purchasing farm goods, and contracting industrial areas to build capital instruments for farming can we hope to begin recovery."
TEX_farm_security_administration:0 "Farm Securities Act"
TEX_farm_security_administration_desc:0 "Sharecroppers and tenant farmers make up a significant portion of our constituency, especially in the core of the South and the Great Plains.

TEX_begin_reconstruction:0 "Rebuild Urban Housing"
TEX_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "The civil war has blasted our country to pieces. Large parts of the rural country are naught but mud and ashes, while countless cities have been reduced to smoldering rubble. We shall set to work developing new housing and infrastructure as soon as possible."
TEX_harsh_reconstruction:0 "Seize Treacherous Wealth"

Lists of majority shareholders in traitorous companies have been seized, and the executive officers of companies that have exploited workers behind the facade of government are now on trial."
TEX_reconciliation:0 "Conditional Forgiveness"
TEX_reconciliation_desc:0 "Congress finally won out against the executive branch, and has decided not to bring charges against seditious companies. Executive officers were pressured to resign in order for their company to be re-listed however, but ultimately the shareholders are deemed innocent of wrongdoing."

TEX_reconstruction_is_over:0 "Reconstruction is Over"
TEX_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "The course of reconstruction has revealed the true ideological basis for why Hoover was unable to fix the economy. The wiser constituents of these windbags have largely voted them out by now, as our GDP rises and the American standard of living rises and even exceeds pre-war levels."
TEX_infrastructure_effort:0 "Infrastructure Efforts"
TEX_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "Technology is rapidly changing our world. The automobile is becoming the main mode of transportation for many people, and we must adjust accordingly. Let us build up our roads and bridges to handle this new demand, and create a national highway system."
TEX_recognize_philantrophers:0 "Recognize Philanthropists"
TEX_recognize_philantrophers_desc:0 "While many members of the wealthy opposed the AUS' efforts to redistribute goods, even within a capitalist economy, there are some who remained neutral in this debate.

TEX_Grand_Army_of_the_Republic:0 "The Grand Army of the Republic"
TEX_Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_desc:0 "An organization from the first American Civil War intended to represent veterans, the organization is on its last legs due to few veterans still surviving. However, we can revive the organization by having recent ACW vets join, giving them a society with internal aid, organization and a means of easily communicating their interests while providing us with new allies."

TEX_dependent_and_disability_act_desc:0 "Based on an older Civil War Act, the GAR is pushing for us to revive the Dependent and Disability Act which would provide Federal pension aid for disabled veterans and widows of dead veterans.

TEX_department_of_public_safety_desc:0 "The Department of Public Safety will not only provide jobs to potential government workers but help regulate industry and consumer products to be safer, rewarding those who best comply with tax breaks. We will do our best to cut down on work accidents."
TEX_work_programs:0 "Veteran Work Programs"

TEX_focus_on_concentration_desc:0 "Force Concentration has been an invaluable tactic for every commander since the times of the Roman Legions.

TEX_focus_on_command_desc:0 "Our enemies in the civil war can be described simply as disorganized and demoralized militias with occassional remnants of the former Army presenting any real resistance.

As such, we will seek to complement the Navy's patrols with naval bombers scouting and intercepting any vessels whenever our fleet is too spread out or too far away to do so."
TEX_Weyland_plan:0 "Parsons Plan"

TEX_flexible_bombers_desc:0 "Since our air force has the task of supporting the army, the bombers of our force will have to adapt to a variety of roles, both as close air support as well as disrupting enemy supplies and comunications in the rear during a battle and we should encourage the development of planes that may fulfil these roles."

TEX_combined_arms_offensive_desc:0 "While our air officers stand at the ready, an issue has arisen once more that impedes the progress of our force: Army officers don't exactly know how to exploit our air power to its fullest potential.

To counter this, we have managed to create and improve heavier designs with longer to have bigger agility to stand a chance in air-to-air combat, and further investment in this area may yield great benefits."

TEX_back_in_business:0 "Back on the World Stage"
TEX_back_in_business_desc:0 "Now that our position as a world power has been restored to us, it is time to figure out where we fit into the scheme of things. Most of our politicians, and people, are urging us towards isolationism. This would be simple, as it would mostly continue the foreign policy America had before the war. However, every isolationist is different, and some say it would be wise to seek allies in this changing world."
TEX_americanist_doctrine:0 "Americanist Doctrine"
TEX_americanist_doctrine_desc:0 "It would not serve us to isolate ourselves, as we have been in the past. At the same time, we will not play second fiddle to some other power.

TEX_popular_monroeism:0 "Review Monroeism"
TEX_popular_monroeism_desc:0 "During the Second Civil War, we largely abandoned our Monroe Doctrine obligations.

We are all Americans in a sense, and we will never suffer colonizers again!"
TEX_populist_alliance:0 "Populist Alliance"
TEX_populist_alliance_desc:0 "The old model of exploitation has been thrown out. Instead, we should win nations over with diplomacy, economic arrangements, and military protection.

TEX_internationale_non_agression_pact:0 "Internationale Peace Agreement"
TEX_internationale_non_agression_pact_desc:0 "Though we may not agree with the Internationale on everything, we share many goals.

TEX_ideological_neutrality:0 "Ideological Neutrality"
TEX_ideological_neutrality_desc:0 "The ideologically-driven conflicts that are now commonplace in our world are worthless in our view.

TEX_oppose_american_syndicalism:0 "Oppose American Syndicalism"
TEX_oppose_american_syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism is too extreme for our tastes. We should make sure that it does not become commonplace in the New World. We should target syndicalist nations in our hemisphere and suggest they either change course or, if they resist, face our intervention."

TEX_investigate_war_lobbyists:0 "Investigate the War Lobby"
TEX_investigate_war_lobbyists_desc:0 "We are swarmed by lobbyists on a daily basis. Instead of letting these people get away with a slap on the wrist, why don't we investigate them?

TEX_break_war_mongerers:0 "Stop American War Mongerers"
TEX_break_war_mongerers_desc:0 "We've had enough of Canada intervening in our affairs. We have kicked the British out of our lands before, but if we are to commit to a new Monroe Doctrine, we have to go farther than that. What shall our next course of action towards them be?"
TEX_contain_hostile_leftism:0 "Strike Left Expansionists"
TEX_contain_hostile_leftism_desc:0 "When leftism goes too far, we must not be afraid to stop it in its tracks. Aggressive left-wing regimes now drown out the more peaceful ones and have significantly drive up world tension. We should act to stop them before it is too late."
TEX_end_carles:0 "Liberate Carlesian Argentina"
TEX_end_carles_desc:0 "Argentina has great potential, but its people suffer under the boot of a dictator. They did not choose him, and he has not given them their proper respect as a leader.

TEX_break_militarists:0 "Break Militarist Aggressors"
TEX_break_militarists_desc:0 "We will attack ultra-nationalist regimes in our backyard, regimes that have caused endless violence and suffering for the people of the New World.

TEX_friendship_in_the_americas_desc:0 "The time has finally come: the Americas are free! Five hundred years ago, Europeans arrived on our shores and began centuries of domination.

TEX_mutual_trade:0 "Mutual Trade"
TEX_mutual_trade_desc:0 "We have no wishes to dominate the nations of Latin America. We want a true brotherhood with these countries.

TEX_research_agreement:0 "Research Initiative"
TEX_research_agreement_desc:0 "We should pursue new technological advances with the help of our new allies, and their resources. With their help, we can gain an edge on our European competitors, and become the most advanced nation in the world!"

TEX_Northern_boundary_defense:0 "Northern Boundary Defense"
TEX_Northern_boundary_defense_desc:0 "The first step in our defence must be to ensure our northern border is well-guarded. Canada and the other members of the Entente decided to involve themselves in our Civil War, despite it being none of their business. How can we be sure they won't intervene again? We should be ready for any move they could make."
TEX_man_the_walls_desc:0 "The first step in our defence must be to ensure our walls are well-guarded. The world should fear American military might, but only if they choose to engage us."
TEX_naval_prominence:0 "Naval Prominence"
TEX_naval_prominence_desc:0 "Though we controlled the Great American Plains during the Civil War, we shouldn't forget Texas. Having access to the sea was a blessing and a curse during the war, but now that we have won, we need to make sure we have a large navy. We shall never be blockaded again, and one day, we will conduct blockades of our own."
TEX_defensive_doctrine:0 "Defensive Military Tactics"
TEX_defensive_doctrine_desc:0 "We should never forget 1812, when foreign invaders burned our capital to the ground. If we want to prevent this from happening again, we should make sure we can defend out country at all costs. No invader will ever reach our capital again, and those bold, or foolish, enough to set foot on our soil will be thrown back."
TEX_aid_paraguay:0 "Favor Paraguay"
TEX_aid_paraguay_desc:0 "As strange as it may sound, Paraguay was one of our closest allies in the Civil War. We should return the favor and aid them in their time of need. The fact that they are surrounded by larger and more powerful neighbors is not lost on us, and we will have to do everything we can to ensure they retain their independence."
TEX_business_of_neutrality:0 "Pragmatic Trade"
TEX_business_of_neutrality_desc:0 "Neutrality has its benefit in that our enemies are few, and thus our trading partners plentiful. If America is to build itself into a true world power, we must do so on the back of the mighty American dollar."
TEX_look_inward:0 "America First"

The most common name floated up is General Terry de la Mesa Allen Jr, although he would need to pressured into the position given his hatred of bureaucracy.

In between his radio shows and his Social Justice publications, he rarely has time to promote Share Our Wealth Societies. This coupled with his increasing emotional instability has led to this day. President [TEX.GetLeader], while silent on this issue, sympathizes with the Jewish citizens for whom Coughlin has flirted with demonizing as he walks the line on lumping them in with international bankers. We must retire Coughlin, but who should replace him? The calmer preacher Billy Graham? Huey's old running mate William Lemke? Or up-and-coming Longist Rush Holt Sr.?"
unionstate.11.a:0 "Billy Graham."
unionstate.11.b:0 "William Lemke."
unionstate.11.c:0 "Rush Holt Sr."

unionstate.12.t:0 "The Long Dynasty"
unionstate.12.d:0 "While it has taken many years for the Long family to mature in the public limelight, the brothers and sons of Huey Long are more worldly because of it. In this time of uncertainty where anybody could be an assassin, should Huey's family occupy the vital positions in the Presidential Cabinet? It is a stretch in confidence for all but the most determined Longists to accept family into the high posts of government."
unionstate.12.a:0 "That's going too far."
unionstate.12.b:0 "You can't go wrong with Long."

unionstate.13.t:0 "Improve the Southern Tenant Farmers Union"
unionstate.13.d:0 "Although the work of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union is well appreciated, the name itself that provides homes to thousands is still the butt of jokes. The tenants are exasperated about the name of their organization. A visit to the office and a reprint is all it takes to correct that snafu. While [TEX.GetLeader] was inside, he decided to improve and integrate other parts of the newly christened American Tenant Farmers Union into his political machine."
unionstate.13.a:0 "Say hello to the AFTU."

unionstate.14.t:0 "The Truth about Hugo Black"
unionstate.14.d:0 "When the Honorable Hugo Black was appointed office on the coattails of Huey Long's victory, very few had bothered to check his past associations. This is why today's newspaper shocked President [TEX.GetLeader] so greatly. An expose found Hugo Black's Klan membership. Hugo Black responded to the press by profusely apologizing, and saying that his membership was just perfunctory in order to get elected in Alabama. While Black's judicial record does paint him as a liberal, this flies directly in the face of Long's anti-Klan campaign. Should we fire Hugo Black?"
unionstate.14.a:0 "An intolerable association."
unionstate.14.b:0 "A man can change."

unionstate.15.t:0 "Schism in Share Our Wealth Societies"
unionstate.15.d:0 "To Share Our Wealth societies throughout America, [TEX.GetLeader] has enlisted not only party members but also former government employees. These new employees were directed by William Lemke, and were paid on the federal payroll. Now there exists a tension between the old and the new in Share Our Wealth. Old guard leader Francis Townsend advocates for Share Our Wealth to remain a non-governmental entity to prevent partisan politics, while Lemke wishes to officiate it as a Federal Department."
unionstate.15.a:0 "Side with Townsend."
unionstate.15.b:0 "Side with Lemke"

unionstate.16.t:0 "McTeague released in theaters"
unionstate.16.d:0 "A tale of greed and betrayal that once littered America is now encapsulated in the new film McTeague. A social commentary by director Erich von Stroheim about the corrupting power of wealth is seen by many as a parable to the state of America before the Civil War. This massive four-hour epic film had it's ending altered from the original book, where a kind stranger intervenes in the death struggle of McTeague and whisks him away from Death Valley back to civilisation."
unionstate.16.a:0 "I had a good nap watching."

unionstate.17.t:0 "Accusations of Crypto-Socialism"
unionstate.17.d:0 "The public’s understanding of Share Our Wealth and Every Man A King is predicated largely on song and slogan. Although many Americans today sing along, there persist Democrats who continue to say our program is crypto-socialism, especially among Texan Democrats. Their contention is slowly damaging our reputation within the nation. Perhaps we should grant Texas more autonomy to calm their accusations."
unionstate.17.a:0 "No, this is a NATIONAL program"
unionstate.17.b:0 "Exempt our Texan allies"

unionstate.18.d:0 "Up in the sky! It's a bird? It's a plane? No, it's Superman! Saving America from the terror of the Klan of the Fiery Cross. This latest series is the brainchild of Siegel and Shuster partnered with an anti-Klan advocate Stetson Kennedy. This tale has successfully embarrassed the illegal organization further, something that is much needed considering the damage they've done to our nation."
unionstate.18.a:0 "Kids love it."

unionstate.19.t:0 "Governor Long Fires on Protesters"
unionstate.19.d:0 "Governor Earl Long has long dodged accusations of corruption and mismanagement of money. As the brother of President Huey Long, Earl has been immune from prosecution and is usually handled delicately by the press. Earl's administeration has been charged to distribute veteran benefits and basic income to the people of Louisiana, with the assumption that all loyal Americans would be deserving of this welfare. A group of concerned citizens, including hundreds of veterans and poor from Norther Louisiana have gathered in Baton Rouge, claiming that Earl Long has withheld their income and benefits. Governor Earl tried to speak to the crowd, claiming that the funds have yet to arrive from the capital, and to disperse until that day. The protesters, many of whom were black veterans, began chanting for Earl's resignation. While accounts differ about what happened next, anywhere from 20-50 people lie dead among the protesters. It now lies with President Huey to pick up the pieces. Governor Earl is appealing to his brother to help him with damage control. The press are not quite at a fever pitch, and any move Huey does could swing public opinion at the moment. "
unionstate.19.a:0 "Attend the funerals of the protesters."
unionstate.19.b:0 "Help Earl cover this up."

unionstate.20.t:0 "Black No More"
unionstate.20.d:0 "The imaginations and political opinions of Americans were piqued when Black No More, written by author George Schuyler, appeared on bookshelves. The book is a science fiction about a scientist who invents a machine that can turn a black man white. This invention turns society upside down, and challenges ideas on race and the one drop principle. The book continues with the revelation that all the characters, both white and black, are mixed race, and the entire principle of racial supremacy collapses. While there were concerns that the book would be censored due to its veiled attacks against both white supremacists and black leaders, it appears that President [TEX.GetLeader] enjoys the book."
unionstate.20.a:0 "As long as it doesn't offend me."

unionstate.21.t:0 "Election Demands!"
unionstate.21.d:0 "As it is clear the AUS is attempting to take up the former mantle of the original American Government, there have been increasing demands for an election to decide the future leader of America in a democratic manner. With a political structure that mimics the old electoral structure of America, the progressives and leftover democratic party have been most vocal in this endeavor. As we rely on their support just to keep afloat, there is not much we can do but agree for now."
unionstate.21.a:0 "Very well!"

unionstate.2100.t:0 "National Progressive Campaign"
unionstate.2100.d:0 "The National Progressive Party has expanded beyond the La Follette families immediate domain and is now dominant in many farm regions in the North and Mid-West. Campaigning on a platform of political reform and of endorsing progressive economics free of "corruption", a clear reference to the AFP. Having already absorbed most of the remaining Republican Party, they poss a significant threat to the left-wing of the AFP and, of course, have already eaten into our progressive and farmer support, leaving some to say we should pay more lip service to our left-wing."
unionstate.2100.a:0 "Promise them more!"
unionstate.2100.b:0 "No, we would alienate the right"

unionstate.2101.t:0 "Texas Democrats Attempt a Resurgence"
unionstate.2101.d:0 "After a long struggle between Ma Ferguson and W. Lee O'Daniel in Texas, it seems that O'Daniel has emerged as the standardbearer of Texas Democrats. However, he is not content with this outcome, and he has begun to campaign on the national stage. O'Daniel hopes to bring his populist message and conservative economic policies to all Americans, and though he is officially a Democrat, he has deviated from traditional Democratic messaging and campaigning in his embrace of some of Huey Long's rhetoric. His campaign, drawing from his radio audience and traditional Democrat voters overall, has quickly amassed support nationwide, and O'Daniel threatens to overshadow Long as the man Americans look up to for guidance. His charisma should not be underestimated, and perhaps we should take Texas more seriously to try and shut him up."
unionstate.2101.a:0 "Take him down!"
unionstate.2101.b:0 "Why should we take a flour salesman seriously?"

unionstate.22.t:0 "Formation of the Christian Party"
unionstate.22.d:0 "With the growth of the Silver Legion under William Dudley Pelley and the announcement of the election, the Christian Party has announced it will stand at the next elections. Eating into the support of the right-wing of the AFP and the now rump Democratic Party, the Christian Party is running on a protestant Christian Democratic platform with progressive economic policies including wealth dividends and full employment. Perhaps we should pander to our right-wing so as to stop their support?"
unionstate.22.a:0 "Yes, of course"
unionstate.22.b:0 "That would do more harm than good"

unionstate.23.t:0 "Long associate disappears!"
unionstate.23.d:0 "A shocking scandal in Louisiana took place earlier this week when Sam Irby, the uncle to Long's secretary and rumored mistress, disappeared from his hotel room in the Gardner Hotel after it is said members of the Louisiana Bureau of Criminal Identification entered the building! This is a blow to the opposition Democrats whom are rumoured to have been interviewing Irby about Long's supposed affair with Irby's niece. Already accusations of kidnapping have taken place but neither Long nor his secretary have commented on it."
unionstate.23.a:0 "How shocking!"

unionstate.2300.d.marland:0 "The election results are in in the contest between Huey Long's AFP, Bob La Follette Jr.'s NPP and William Dudley Pelley's Christian Party, alongside E.W. Marland's Democratic Party which calls for a reintegration into the Pacific. Which shall it be?"
unionstate.2300.d.generic:0 "The election results are in in the contest between Huey Long's AFP, Bob La Follette Jr.'s NPP, William Dudley Pelley's Christian Party, with the Democratic Party being split between two factions, a Western wing and a wing in Texas, led by W. Lee O'Daniel. Though these factions may be too weak to win this cycle, their goals of either joining with the Pacific States or completely reimagining Huey Long's proposals may win out. Which shall it be?"

unionstate.24.d:0 "The man widely reported kidnapped earlier this week, Sam Irby, has reappeared unharmed! Irby claims that he kidnapped himself to throw off 'less than friendly loaners', a story few actually believe. AFP opponents accuse Long of wanting to hide Irby until the election was over to avoid potential scandals that would result from the man selling stories about Huey to the press but with Irby and his dapper new clothes claiming otherwise there is nothing they can do."
unionstate.24.a:0 "How about that!"

unionstate.26.t:0 "The Texas Devils"
unionstate.26.d:0 "The Texas Rangers are under our jurisdiction and their leader Col. Lee Simmons are loyal to us. They are currently struggling to contain the many domestic terrorist threats in our nation however. He has requested that we green light a plan to bring back famed Ranger Frank Hamer to once again tackle the Klan in our territory and provide funding to do so. This would undoubtedly weaken the Klan but perhaps their efforts would be more useful elsewhere?"
unionstate.26.a:0 "Greenlight it"
unionstate.26.b:0 "Target generic robbers instead"
unionstate.26.c:0 "Have them help train the troops instead"

unionstate.27.t:0 "Bonnie and Clyde gang"
unionstate.27.d:0 "While crime in rampant throughout the territory as criminals look to make a easy buck from the unstable nature of America one criminal group in particular has gained infamy, namely the Barrow gang. This is largely due to the sensationalist takes on Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, a couple apparently leading the gang and whom are often called Bonnie and Clyde for short. The activities of the whole gang involve mainly robberies sometimes even of banks, but increasingly members of law enforcement are getting gunned down, partly due to the heavy firepower the gang is packing. Famously Clyde Barrow himself carries a Browning Automatic Rifle. Unfortunately the gang is gaining an undeserved folksy reputation and undermining the legitimacy of the state, how should we respond?"
unionstate.27.a:0 "Send the Texas Rangers"
unionstate.27.b:0 "Send the National Guard"
unionstate.27.c:0 "We don't have the resources for this"

unionstate.28.t:0 "Pendergast Machine"
unionstate.28.d:0 "Tom Pendergast is the political boss of Kansas City and Jackson County with a reputation for running his cities as his personal fiefdom. Nonetheless, he is not very welcoming towards the Constitutional American Republic whom hope to displace him and his system with the Old Democrats and other more hardcore white supremacists and prohibitionists whom view Pendergast as a seller of vice which in all honesty he is. Certainly this does not make him the greater evil to us nor are we to him, leading to him asking for protection. His machine would undermine the AFP power and not be wholly popular but would provide the AUS as a whole with greater resources, men who could be recruited in his territory and assistance from Pendergast's organized crime allies who could make our lives easier and CAR's more difficult. On the other hand we could just run AFP candidates in his territory and scare off him and his ally mobster Charles Carrollo by threatening to charge them should they not leave. What should we do?"
unionstate.28.a:0 "Make the alliance"
unionstate.28.b:0 "Kansas City ain't big enough for the two of us"

unionstate.29.t:0 "The Southern Tenant Farmers Union"
unionstate.29.d:0 "The Southern Tenant Farmers Union is a left-wing bureau for tenant farmers legally operating within our territory and supporting the American Union State over the rightist Constitutional American Republic, whom are repressing the STFU in their territory. This makes them potentially useful allies as they can help disrupt activities within the CAR if provided funding and perhaps even giving its leader Harry Leland Mitchell a seat on our cabinet. However, some in the party are reluctant to do so due to it being widely known the STFU has heavy sympathies with some of the Combined Syndicates of America despite not being based out of their territory. Providing support will surely help us shore up support but nonetheless would increase socialist sympathies and anger social conservatives who dislike the STFU's progressive stance on race issues."
unionstate.29.a:0 "Provide some support"
unionstate.29.b:0 "Put them on Our Cabinet"
unionstate.29.c:0 "I don't think so"

unionstate.30.t:0 "Progressive Merger Proposed"
unionstate.30.d:0 "Huey's main ally in Congress and now in the AUS has long been the Midwest Progressive and Farmer-Labor organizations despite an occasionally tense relationship due to disagreements with Long's style of populism and alleged demagoguery. However a recent proposal would strengthen this alliance. It comes from Alfred Mitchell Bingham, a radical activist and lead editor of the periodical Common Sense, is supportive of progressivism, the AFP and the right-wing of the CSA and is responsible for running the American Farmer-Labor Federation. The AFLF is made up of middle-class activists organizing mainly for the working class and which has connections with the AFP, the Progressives and even Bellaymists in the CSA. Despite the Federations flexibility it's stance on economic issues revolves around economic planning when it comes to agrarian goods and recently Bingham and other members of the Federation have begun to see the AFP as the best possible route to a radical but patriotic future. They have proposed forming the American Commonwealth Co-operative Movement, under which they would openly join the AFP in a political alliance. While this would shore up our support among left-leaning activists and undermine the National Progressive Party has potential competition it could tie us to more left-wing economic policies than some of our party members are comfortable with."
unionstate.30.a:0 "Of Course Not"
unionstate.30.b:0 "Absolutely, a fantastic opportunity"

unionstate.3001.t:0 "Second Great Migration"
unionstate.3001.d:0 "Despite the attempts of the Constitutional American Republic to force black Americans to stay in their territory, an increasingly large number of Black Americans are fleeing to the North and West. The total is likely numbering in at least a million, with many seeking to settle in our territory due to its obvious proximity. In particular, the urban regions of Texas are seeing an inflow of Black migrants but the machines representing many whites, particularly the questionably loyal local Democratic Parties as well as part of the AFP, are demanding we take away their right to vote so as to not threaten their political supremacy. White populists such as Gerald L.K. Smith suggest also stopping anymore blacks from entering so as to not threaten the white working class. However, much of the AFP and Progressives disagree with this and alongside our generals see an opportunity for recruitment and potential factory workers. They recommend allowing the migrants to settle and recruiting them at once."
unionstate.3001.a:0 "Let them in"
unionstate.3001.b:0 "Let them in, but they can't vote"
unionstate.3001.c:0 "Announce we won't be taking in anymore"

unionstate.3002.t:0 "The Old Regulars"
unionstate.3002.d:0 "The Regular Democratic Organization is Louisian's political machine for conservative Democrats and are Long's traditional opponents in his home state. Despite this the two have made alliances in the past and with the "Old Regulars" having questionable loyalty to the AUS over CAR or the USA now might be the time to make another such alliance, agreeing not to run AFP candidates in Southern Louisiana in return for them not openly opposing us. Of course, some Old Regulars have already crossed over to the Old Democrats and refuse to support Long, begging the question of whether we should simply "investigate" the organization for corruption and have it basically shut down which would also increase the AFP's hold on the state. Of course, this would push the old money elite even more against Long as well as the most ardent white supremacists."
unionstate.3002.a:0 "Cede part of Louisiana"
unionstate.3002.b:0 "Investigate them"

unionstate.3003.t:0 "Black Troop Debate!"
unionstate.3003.d:0 "The question of black combat troops has long been a contentious one in the United States, with race traditionalists insisting that blacks lack the intellectual faculties to be combat troops whereas others insist this is an absurd position and simply robs us of much needed soldiers. Currently Gerald L.K. Smith leads the charge on behalf of race traditionalists, insisting that blacks can not be expected to be soldiers and gain the same benefits as white soldiers. Charles Coughlin and much the Silver Legion are in accordance with this, although Pelley himself is ambivalent about letting Northern Blacks join as combat troops. He is a hardliner when it comes to Southern Blacks, insisting they lack the 'intelligence and civility' to be troops. On the other side, Jacob Devers, the AFP machine in Louisiana and the Radicals in the AUS such as the Non-Partisan League, have pushed for black combat troops, admonishing the traditionalists for wanting to choose defeat just to spite blacks. They insist we should have Devers lead a recruitment campaign."
unionstate.3003.a:0 "We need black troops"
unionstate.3003.b:0 "We can not allow it"

unionstate.3004.t:0 "Minneapolis Syndicalists Strike!"
unionstate.3004.d:0 "While the state of Minnesota is in the control of the farmer-labor party, there remains a strong IWW element within Minneapolis whom have grown increasingly unstable since former governor Floyd Olson, whom held amicable relations with them, died. Now they are clearly desiring to join the CSA, and putting down their strikes would not only antagonize the socialists but cost us some manpower. Either we will have to pay them off or send national guard to quell them. Of course some radicals in the AFP would prefer to just give them semi-autonomy in Minneapolis, allowing them to run it along more syndicalist lines so long as they do not attack members of the middle and upper class living there, and instead we will pay off business owners. They claim this will quell their anger altogether."
unionstate.3004.a:0 "Pay them off"
unionstate.3004.b:0 "Break them"
unionstate.3004.c:0 "Give them some autonomy"

unionstate.3005.t:0 "Silver Legion Grows"
unionstate.3005.d:0 "For conservatives who are dissapointed in the Democratic Party for their lack of populist credentials compared to other factions but who are also turned off by the AFP's and NPP's progressivism, the Silver Legion's mix of conservatism and wealth redistribution has become an increasingly attractive alternative. The Democrats are becoming increasingly unpopular among the farmers and 'legacy' democrats who supported them before and are increasingly a party of tradesmen and some middle-class iberals based largely out of Texas."
unionstate.3005.a:0 "Interesting"

unionstate.3006.t:0 "Leander Perez Controversy!"
unionstate.3006.d:0 "Leander Perez is an openly corrupt judge, hardline segregationalist and political boss operating out of Louisiana whom has made an alliance of pragmatism with Huey Long. Recently he has found himself in a controversy as journalists working for our political opponents have discovered his mishandling of oil leases under his watch, handing out contracts for bribes or to companies he ownes. Perez is a powerful ally but his handling of the oil contracts is forcing us to take a stand on this. Of course, this could be an opportunity to get rid of Perez, especially since in the future he will likely cause problems if we stray from his vision."
unionstate.3006.a:0 "Defend him"
unionstate.3006.b:0 "Have him step down"

unionstate.3007.t:0 "Perez Demands Compensation!"
unionstate.3007.d:0 "Perez is infuriated by our attempts to make him stand down! He is demanding that we compensate him for his work if we desire to maintain our current alliance, and has threatened us if we take legal action, claiming he has more than enough evidence to take Long down with him. What should we do?"
unionstate.3007.a:0 "Pay him off"
unionstate.3007.b:0 "Get rid of him"

unionstate.3008.t:0 "Leander Perez Kidnapped!"
unionstate.3008.d:0 "Leander Perez has recently disappeared after a falling out with Huey Long. According to reports, the fight was over his position as district attorney within Louisiana and his diversion of funds Long wanted to fund the war effort. He was apparently ambushed exiting a courthouse and entering his car, after which whomever was already in the car and the driver kidnapped him. Why his bodyguards did not intervene is unknown but while Long has blamed the dissappearance on socialists most don't doubt that Perez is in a swamp somewhere. With an example made, we could allow the machine he set up to go back to its usual business or we could appoint one of our own, which may be useful if we do not plan to follow the right-wing agenda of the Perez machine, with Cat Doucet being floated as an AFP representative who can take the plce of Perez and reform his machine to be more in-line with our values."
unionstate.3008.a:0 "Let the Machine do what it will"
unionstate.3008.b:0 "Cat Doucet should be rewarded for his loyalty"

unionstate.34.d:0 "The wealthiest American families whom aligned themselves with MacArthur such as Rockefeller and Morgan made a point to destroy Long so that they may end the notion of a wealth ceiling that would see them far less wealthy. Their gambled failed however, and while they have fled the nation we have taken control of their businesses left here in the states. For the large stockholders, we will have to decide if we should wholly take control of these businesses, and sell them to someone new, or allow them to retake control under new corporate leadership so long as they pay fines."

unionstate.35.t:0 "Smith Walks Out!"
unionstate.35.d:0 "Gerald L.K. Smith has finally had 'enough' of our shifting the party to the left and declared that he is formally joining the Christian Party, declaring us race traitors who are unwilling to stand against 'Jewish Power and syndicalist radicals'. He takes with him much of the right-wing of the AFP, leaving us more reliant on collecting former leftists to vote for us."
unionstate.35.a:0 "So be it"

unionstate.36.t:0 "Virgil Effinger killed!"
unionstate.36.d:0 "In a cabin in Tennessee, Virgil Effinger and 12 members of the Black Legion were killed today when they were tracked down by AFP Minutemen who opened fire on the cabin in the dead of night. The Black Legion has decied this as a war crime, claiming that Effinger was not only given no chance to surrender but that Black Legion watchmen were killed before they could issue a warning, meaning the Minutemen had no intention of giving them a chance to surrender. However the operation is being celebrated across America and Ranger Manuel T. Gonzaullas, whom lead the raid, is already being awared with medals as this will most assuredly kneecap the Black Legion."
unionstate.36.a:0 "Even more victories!"

unionstate.38.t:0 "Klan Clemency?"
unionstate.38.d:0 "With our decision to reconciliate the South old class we must decide how far to go in granting clemency to the Klan. Should we pardon lower-level members whom have take an oath of loyalty or simply force the American First Party in the South keep them in prison and try to keep Klan presence to a minimum, threatening them with retaliation if they go beyond talk."
unionstate.38.a:0 "Grant Clemency"

unionstate.39.t:0 "Southern Party Head"
unionstate.39.d:0 "The AFP has successfully expanded into the South using the old Democrat machines in the region for our own gain, but who should lead the organization in the deep south? There is Richard Russell Jr, who was a known moderate during the war and one of the more reluctant members of CAR, openly hoping they would shift closer to the center, however he is somewhat too socially conservative for many. Then there is James Eastland, who is more hardline on race issues but far more open to Long's economic agenda. Finally, we could pull some strings to place Earl Long in charge of the region."

unionstate.41.t:0 "Dallas Klan Attacks Share Our Wealth!"
unionstate.41.d:0 "The Dallas Klan is known for having had a a more ambiguous relationship with the National Klan and did not outright side with the CAR, saving itself from the state crackdowns that destroyed or damaged other Klans in the American Union State. However, with our embrace of the black vote they seem to think they have made a mistake, and have vandalized a local Share Our Wealth club, followed by sending threatening letters to black reverends now embracing Huey Long.

unionstate.42.t:0 "AFP Southern Leader"
unionstate.42.d:0 "As the AFP machine consumes the Southern Democrats and Old Democrats machines we will need to entrust a leader to oversee that our sympathizers, including black voters, are put on the voting rolls there. We could place longtime loyalist Rush Limbaugh Sr, who lead the AFP in the region throughout the war in the region, in charge. Another choice is Civil War veteran and AFP rising star Sid McMath. Finally, we could pull some strings to put Earl in charge."

unionstate.44.d:0 "The newest political film out of Hollywood is proving to be a smashing success! My First One Hundred Days is a film about Huey Long's first 100 Days after winning the America Civil War and bringing peace and prosperity to the United States, as directed by Gregory La Cava. With an opening with the actual Huey Long endorsing the film and wishing all Americans well, critics claim that the film being funded by the AFP makes it little more than a piece of government propaganda. Nonetheless, it is popular with Americans looking for an optimistic view of the nation, a promise of unity and a leader who will protect them."
unionstate.44.a:0 "Very Good!"

unionstate.45.t:0 "Fate of Standard Oil"
unionstate.45.d:0 "With Standard Oil coming under our control, we have decided to keep the oil in Louisiana under government control. However the fate of the rest of our national reserves has come under debate, with some wanting us to break up Standard Oil into many companies and the US government simply owning a share of it while hardliners in the AFP would prefer if we just keep the oil nationalized and use the funds towards national projects."
unionstate.45.a:0 "Break it up"

unionstate.46.t:0 "Power of Congress"

Charles Coughlin, noting his own movement and his ability to bring the largest crowd of anyone to honor Huey, has claimed that a true man of god should deliver the speech. To this, Smith shot back that he was a better priest than Coughlin ever was, and a better speaker at that. Earl Long, meanwhile, merely noted that his family never had much love for Romanism. Amidst the bickering, the various leftist factions have united around Bronson Cutting as their speaker of choice, noting his quiet but stalwart support for Long's proposals through his career. Few have paid close attention to this, with all opposed accusing Cutting of harboring secret anti-Longist views. A compromise candidate has also emerged, in the form of Russell B.

Meanwhile, the Bellamyists under Alfred Bingham are reluctant to support such a depiction, fearful of the ramifications it might have for their movement, specifically their supposed plans for democracy. Instead, they argue that any monument should take a form similar to the Lincoln Memorial, with emphasis on Long's visionary ability rather than his power. Father Charles Coughlin, meanwhile, has advocated a humble, human-size statue of Huey Long, so that he can be with the people as he was in life.

It is often said that Smith was aligned with Father Charles Coughlin for this task, and that the two figures were never loyal to begin with, given Coughlin's movement and Smith's naked ambition. Meanwhile, others, including Smith and Coughlin, responded by accusing Earl Long of involvement in the assassination. They note Earl's strained relationship with his brother, and his inability to find a place in the sun so long as Huey was alive. With his brother dead, they argue, Earl is free to gain the power he always wanted. Smith has also taken to blaming the Bellamyist faction as well, arguing that the Independence League has closer ties to the Red Belt than it ever did to Huey Long.

Now, many of the policies called for by Sinclair years ago are being seriously considered for implementation by the Bingham administration. This is not without controversy, as Sinclair joined the ranks of the now defunct Pacific government during the Civil War. There are no two ways about it, Sinclair is a traitor who joined an illegitimate government and believed the Union State strayed too far from the democratic vision of America. Nonetheless, the President believes that although he was on the wrong side of history, Sinclair is still a good man with good ideas and a genuine commitment to bettering America. Bingham has even considered inviting Sinclair into the administration as Secretary of Commerce. The rest of the cabinet advise that such a move could hurt the President's perception among the people after the droves of anti-Pacific propaganda we issued. Vice President Amlie suggests that the EPIC Plan be adopted nationwide, but stop short of making him an official.

Of course, the war is now behind us, and Bingham bears no ill towards his old friend for siding with the Syndicalists. After all, it was Dewey who taught Bingham the importance of having pragmatism. In fact, the President wishes to formally rehabilitate and reward Dewey for his decades of service to the country by bringing him into his administration. Most of the cabinet agrees, suggesting Dewey and other Bellamyists be sent as an advisor to develop and ideally, promote our policies, in the Red Belt. In this post he could educate and help administrators in the region to better implement policy by employing his many great ideas. While Bingham supports sending Bellamyists to the Red Belt, he is more partial to having Dewey specifically oversee education in the country. Dewey is best known for his work in education reform, and this would effectively hand him the reins to complete his vision of transforming educational institutions into progressive services that will advance society and promote constant intellectual growth, concepts that Bingham has long admired.

No, if America is to complete what the late President Long started, we must expel this fifth column faith from our borders. With this new executive order, the Smith administration has called for a 'Second Exodus', in which the Jews shall be exiled from this country so they may find some new land to subvert and sabotage. Headlines from the American Progress highlight the many  neighborhoods who rejoice and celebrate as the deportations begin. Others, fearing the reprisals, can only mourn the loss of their neighbors, friends, and fellow Americans quietly. For the Jews themselves, there is only despair as they say goodbye to the land of the free, and the hope that wherever they may end up, they can be free at last..."

unionstate.5119.t:0 "Pursuing the Financiers"
unionstate.5119.d:0 "President Coughlin is finally poised to pursue one of his greatest goals: combating and demolishing capitalism in favor of his own program of Social Justice. The elites of America have for too long been free and to corrupt the nation into a safe-haven for the greedy profiteers of rotten modern capitalism, united by the gluttonous faith of Judaism! One of the few admirable private sector leaders, Henry Ford, argues that Coughlin should focus on finishing President Long's work in toppling the head of the Jewish beast in Wall Street and in the major industries of wealth and prosperity are to be in the hands of all Americans. However, the publishers of the American Progress  advocate for a focus on combating their enemies in the entertainment industry. Museums, film, festivals, amusement parks, theatre, opera, even Coughlin's beloved radio are trades dominated by sinister Jewish actors! They use these forms of entertainment as propaganda to lie to the people and present a considerable threat to our efforts to implement and uphold the policies of the National Union for Social Justice.  If we continue to allow these actors to corrupt the minds of God's children, the horrors of commercialism and the sophistry of greed and of individualism may never be vanquished. Without question, it is too dangerous to tackle both forces at once. The populace could turn on his quest to bring God's Social Justice to the country if we seize the wealth and imprison both the robber-barons in entertainment and the giants of banking, food service, manufacturing, transportation to have their wealth seized and jailed. Who shall we target first?"

unionstate.5120.t:0 "The Coughlin Question"
unionstate.5120.d:0 "It's no secret that Coughlin has had political aspirations for as long as his radio show was on the air. His apparent interest in leading the once-again united America is now more clearly shown than ever, as he has begun lobbying for changes to the Union's requirements for becoming President. Born in Canada in the late 19th century, he is, according to the Constitution, not eligible to run. However, the bill proposed would allow those with at least 10 years of citizenship and residency in the United States to legally become Commander in-Chief. The bill's proposal has been met with mixed reactions. Some claim that the 'political revolution' brought on by Long and his followers should see new radical changes to how the government is run, and that America should use this opportunity to allow Americanized immigrants to become President, given they've taken time to serve their new country. The next bloc takes a moderate approach. They recognize Coughlin's obvious designs on power and claim that due to his 'exemplary service' during the war to Long and the Union State, he should be given an exception and be allowed to run for President. Huey himself has been in favor of this resolution, seeing it as a fair compromise. Finally, the last group considers itself the most fundamentally true to the old U.S., claiming that 'the original genius of the Founding Fathers', that being the Constitution, shouldn't be altered in any way. They also see the bill as a potentially slippery slope that would allow dangerous foreign actors to wield far more influence in politics than before. These three interest groups have come to a head, with different figures tacitly supporting whichever side aligns best with them, and others outright ignoring it. The results of the vote are as follows:"

unionstate.5121.d:0 "With our control over New England mostly solidifed, we must decided what to do with Alfred Bingham's father, Hiram Bingham III. The elder Bingham has a colorful past; after his birth in Hawaii to a family of Protestant missionaries, he would grow up to attend Yale and teach at Harvard. His fascination with Latin American history led to an expedition to Peru, where he discovered the now-famous site of Machu Pichu. After raising seven sons, including Alfred Bingham, and exploring the world, Hiram Bingham III could have been satisfied with an eventful life. He did not stop there however; his political career took the shape of Governor and then Senator from Connecticut. He served in these offices for years, and when the Second Civil War began, he aligned himself with New England. Despite their often strained relationship, Alfred has a soft spot for his father, and we must decide what should be done with him. Many are clamoring to have him arrested like other traitors, though he has done little to justify this action. Another option would be to send him back to Peru, this time as a diplomat. This would get him out of the way while also allowing him some dignity. Of course, we could just leave him alone, as he is elderly and poses little threat..."

unionstate.5122.t:0 "The Huey Long Museum"
unionstate.5122.d:0 "President Smith has announced the construction of a museum dedicating to the life, ideas, and legacy of the great President Huey P. Long. The Public Works Administration has contracted a team of the finest architects, engineers, historians, low-level AFP bureaucrats, and even academia from the Louisiana State University to build a site fit to commemorate and celebrate Long. Numerous recordings, papers, correspondence, memorabilia, and other materials have been donated by the Long family, associates of the late President, and the America First Party. Historian Harley Bozeman, a close confidant of Long, has directed the operation, and has worked to ensure that every piece of the museum contributes to the goal of remembering Long's accomplishments, ideals, and portraying Huey as the champion of the poor, great leader, and he virtuous man he was. A grand opening is scheduled for the next August 30th, Huey's birthday. While progress continues smoothly, controversy has emerged regarding the way the project will be funded. Left leaning members of the AFP advocate for the museum to be tax funded, which they argue is the least contentious and most convenient option, considering Huey's popularity and our already high tax rate. Rose Long and her family has requested that they be allowed to raise funds for the site, and while this is likely to be extremely successful and could potentially even raise support for the Party, Smith would much rather have himself or one of his key allies lead the fundraiser than a family he sees as rivals. Henry Ford and Secretary of the Interior Meade McClanahan have quietly persuaded Smith to consider having Jewish citizens pay for the project. They frame the issue as one of the Jews needing to give President Smith and America reparations after one of their own murdered Huey Long. After all, the President has already gone so far as to detain famed Jewish Louisiana architect and frequent Long collaborator Leon C. Weiss when he offered his services to the project for suspicions of embezzlement and connection to Long assassin Carl Weiss. This would simply be the next best step in ensuring the Jews don't get away with their heinous act scot free. Regardless, the museum must be paid for somehow, and a decision must be made."

unionstate.5123.t:0 "Seymour Weiss Makes His Move"
unionstate.5123.d:0 "The America First Party has just experienced yet another power struggle as Mayor of New Orleans and close confidant of Huey Long, Seymour Weiss, has attempted to wrestle away control of the Party from President Smith. Pointing to his association with men such as Henry Ford and James Eastland, Weiss has denounced Smith as a traitor to the late Kingfish's vision and a man unfit to succeed him or lead the good people of America. He has even dared to ask major party leaders to join him in voicing opposition to Smith so that they can put in place a new President that will restore the original purpose and ideals the Party once boasted, when the opportunity arises. Weiss' political rebellion was quickly put down following a series of scathing speeches in which the President has attacked Weiss. Smith has asserted that Weiss worked to sabotage Huey Long at every turn, leading a Jewish conspiracy to stop Huey Long from freeing the poor people in America from elitist forces. This conspiracy was responsible for most of Long's more questionable policies and, ultimately, his tragic assassination. Indeed, his Jewish last name is shared by Long's assassin, Dr. Carl Weiss, proving their connection and cementing the allegations as the truth in the eyes of Smith and his supporters. Tensions peaked as battle erupted in the French Quarter of New Orleans at one point, with mobs of enraged citizens threatening to exact revenge on Weiss for the death of Huey clashing with police. This morning, President Smith announced the arrest of Seymour Weiss, officially ending the fight for control. He commented, "It is abundantly clear that Mayor Weiss is guilty of murder, Judeo-negro collaboration, a wide variety of perversions, promoting jazz, thievery, treason, corruption, and tax evasion, and it is my expectation that he will be brought to justice."A mayoral election has been scheduled in New Orleans. Meanwhile, Weiss awaits trial, and a capital punishment sentence is speculated."

In public, the two leaders emphasized the common values of the new China and America in protecting the welfare and freedom of all classes of their people. Privately, talks are said to have proceeded extremely well. While the two leaders do not entirely see eye-to-eye, the ever-pragmatic President Hu was able to find much common ground with his counterpart. Hu, using his excellent English that made negotiations much easier, congratulated his counterpart's administration on its successful and peaceful socialization of the country, excellent living standards, and "first class" education system. Bingham in turn expressed his immense admiration for the Federalist cause, their efforts to bring true republicanism to China, and Hu's willingness to incorporate progressive ideas despite leaning to the right. Thereafter the two quickly bonded over their experiences as two of John Dewey's most successful students. Indeed, it is reported that the two spent over half the time exchanging stories from their time with Dewey and the philosophical beliefs they developed. With the limited time they had left, the leaders hurriedly but productively got to work securing a trade deal between their countries. Returning to the public, Hu and Bingham together promised to lower tariffs on the others goods, protect each other's shipping on the seas if endangered, and exchange think tanks and other non-profit groups. The summit concluded with Hu and Bingham gifting the other one of their works, An Outline History in Chinese Philosophy and Insurgent America; Revolt of the Middle Classes, respectively. Both Presidents expressed their great anticipation of the next summit."

unionstate.5125.d:0 "The Little Flower shine was originally named to honor Saint Thérèse of Lisieux, a French Catholic who passed only a few decades ago. However, its more immediate significance comes from it being the place where Charles Coughlin first settled as a pastor in America. It was here that Coughlin grew his support, and in a Protestant community no less. It was also a site of a KKK cross burning, an action which angered Coughlin, who thereafter opposed the organization. Now that the war is over, Coughlin has turned his attention to his old stomping grounds. His attention has come at just the right time; a recent revovation of the site finished after fire damage destroyed the old wooden structure of the building in 1936, and now, Coughlin has designated it as a national shrine. The church, much larger than before, is now nationally renowned and stands as one of America's finest churches."

Though Coughlin reportedly leans towards jaililng such people, some in his administration have urged him to reconsider, instead insisting that they merely be removed from any government positions or other areas of power. This act would target men like Alfred Mitchell Bingham, Bronson M. Cutting, Sid McMath, Joseph C.O. Mahoney, and more. For their part, these men have protested, noting that they are neither syndicalits nor communists, and insist that Coughlin stands down. Coughlin is not willing to do this; he has promised millions that he would root out the causes of corruption, deceit, and treachery in our government, and this is one step towards doing so.

However, Huey Long broke their power in 1935, and now that he is gone, they have been forced into loyalty to Earl Long. These powerful Louisiana figures represent a godsend for Earl Long, who has struggled to shore up support in state governments around the country, with many still unconvinced of his ability to succeed his brother. The Old Regulars under their new Longist leader, Robert S. Maestri, have begun to change that impression. Seeing their success, Uncle Earl has decided that it might be worth it to expand the idea of state 'Old Regulars' nationally, or at least to states around the South.

unionstate.5129.d:0 "This afternoon marks the grand opening of the latest in the line of President Smith's pet projects. The President and Secretary of the Interior Meade McClanahan have dreamed of construction their "Sacred Project" ever since the Civil War concluded. Upon taking office, Smith quietly commissioned sculptor Emmett Sullivan to make this dream a reality and lead the construction of a life-sized recreation of ancient Jerusalem as it appeared in the time of Christ. The Springfield Plateau within the Ozark Mountains on the border of Arkansas and Missouri was chosen for its stunning geographic similarity to Jerusalem. There a massive team was assembled to carry out the project, and over the next several years progress was reportedly steady, but strained. The President himself donated over $1,000,000 to the project from his own pocket and raised much more, but rumors of the Jewish population being coerced to "gift" great sums to the creation of the New Jerusalem were pervasive until the mass deportations of the Jews. Indeed, a massive statue of Christ was built to overlook the city, representing the Christian victory over the Jewish and Roman forces that occupied Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the work is done, and the President has officially opened up the city for the good Christian public to enjoy! Upon entering, however, visitors were shocked to learn that the "city" was more of a Jerusalem styled Christian theme park. Artworks are in every building, the center of the metropolis holds an amphitheater where the Passion of Christ is retold. Even more startling were the "Museum of Earth History", exploring the true, creationist history of the world, and the rollercoaster ride depicting Jesus' journey carrying the Cross up to Calvary Hill. Surprisingly, despite subverting expectations, the site has had a very successful first day. Numerous attendees left feeling reinvigorated, thrilled, and even more devout! Tourism in the Ozarks is expected to boom, and President Smith is most pleased."

unionstate.5130.d:0 "One of the most vicious and prominent opponents of the Coughlin administration has been Frances Sweeney, lead editor and author of the Boston City Reporter. Sweeney, a Catholic herself and well known in the Irish-American community, began her rise to stardom by denouncing the Irish gangs in Boston who, inspired by President Coughlin's rhetoric, terrorized the Jewish population of the city. Her advocacy helped to raise awareness of the extent of the antisemitism of the city and convince the Mayor of Boston, James Michael Curley, to provide greater police protection for the Jewish neighborhoods. Her passionate work was eyed with cautious optimism by AFP officials hoping to potentially sway her to become a voice for Coughlin's wider agenda. However, Sweeney was not content to deal with Boston alone. In her rapidly expanding paper, she has criticized the America First Party as a corrupt organization and President Coughlin as a man who has strayed from the Church and distorted the Lord's message. In her scathing articles, Sweeney has openly called Coughlin an anti-semite and demanded for him to stop subverting the liberties of fellow Americans and our “elder brothers in the faith”, who have endured much of the same oppression that Catholics in America have. Indeed, her threat is so great that at every single AFP event she protests, her followers grow larger."

unionstate.5131.t:0 "A Problem No More"
unionstate.5131.d:0 "Cardinal O’Connell of Boston’s excommunication of Sweeney was expected to quell her dissent, but only inflamed it. More and more progressive Catholics and people disillusioned with the administration have endorsed Sweeney and joined her efforts across the nation. President Coughlin has decided he had enough. After Congress passed an act transferring Sweeney’s assets and the Boston City Reporter to the government, Minutemen reportedly raided the headquarters of her newspaper. Charged with “actions aimed at undermining national security” and “subverting federal authority.” Sweeney’s trial was little more than a kangaroo court, thanks to executive pressure. After a brief month of proceedings, Frances Sweeney was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason. Despite Sweeney’s young age, her health has rapidly declined due to rheumatic heart disease. With her life expectancy low after only barely surviving a heart attack this morning, Sweeney’s supporters mourn their defeat, and many Catholics and Jews quietly reflect on the life and work of the brave young journalist and question what is next for the country. For now, however, President Coughlin has gotten one step closer to realizing his great ambitions for America, and celebrates the peace from overcoming this upstart opposition."

In the outskirts of L.A, this compound was built a ranch to sustain the Silver Legion in case of a syndicalist victory. Murphy Ranch, as it is called, now has the ability to become fully operational. Should we continue to fortify the homestead to protect our new Californian brothers? Or should we convert the land into a workplace for our reborn American industry?"

unionstate.53.t:0 "Can You See The Real Pelley?"
unionstate.53.d:0 "Although only known to the highest-ranking members of The Silver Legion, there is a hidden depth in the mind of our Chief Pelley. To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend. He is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now, a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one and the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well-accepted in this brave new American society, should we go public with some of his more... esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers, as it is, can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public at large. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"

unionstate.54.d:0 "During a controversial speech presidential candidate William Dudley Pelley endorsed what he has called the 'Ward System' for various groups labeled 'unproductive' which would ensure they do not receive full Commonwealth benefits until they are labeled as productive and would be relegated to largely labor jobs in the mean time. Naturally this has attracted a large amount of criticism while also appealing to former Democrats and racially conservative Republicans despite Pelley's claim the Ward System is 'radically different' from the ODP's Segregation platforms. Perhaps speaking out against it can increase our percent of the black and liberal votes, although it does threaten to drive away some voters."

unionstate.55.t:0 "The Silver Cavalcade!"
unionstate.55.d:0 "With President Pelley having won a surprise electoral victory it has become clear that he needs to further his grassroots support if his most ambitious plans are to have any hope of succeeding. After several meetings with his advisors the President believes he has come up with the ideal plan for this, a nationwide barnstorming tour with members of the Christian Party and the Silver Legion. Seen live, broadcast both on radio and recorded to be shown after the fact, the Silver Cavalcade as it is now being called internally will surely spread our message further than ever before."
unionstate.55.a:0 "Fund it"
unionstate.55.b:0 "Actually, let's wait on this"

unionstate.56.t:0 "Jewish Segregation?"
unionstate.56.d:0 "As our platform is implemented more and more, one of the President's more controversial ideas has again reared its head. In Pelley’s mind the influence of the American Jewish population on both the capitalist and syndicalist systems and the growing population of politically aware Gentiles necessitates that they need to be stripped of certain rights for the time being, ostensibly for their own protection. Under the plan the Jewish population in each state would be moved to a single city until the Commonwealth system is fully implemented, at which time the President promises they will again receive full rights. Regardless of his promises though the idea has attracted outrage from a not insignificant portion of the population who claim it will lead to mass abuses and other rights violations, and on the other hand the hardliners in the Christian Party are demanding an immediate implementation of the plan. It seems like no matter what choice we make could cause us further problems in the future."

Several elements of the Christian Party, particularly those in California, have taken their rhetoric far and beyond what the national leadership has. Led by Henry D. Allen's wing of the party as well as the increasingly controversial Gerald L.K. Smith it espouses radical racialist doctrines and promoting ideas such as the mass expulsion of Jews from the United States, these groups are increasingly harming the Presidents image and one way or another we need to make a choice on how to best handle the situation, with Willard Kemp offering to help reign them in via private conversations and threats of expulsion."

unionstate.58.d:0 "One of the more peculiar parts of President Pelley’s beliefs are his esoteric approach to Christianity. Known under several different names in prior years, Soulcraft Doctrine as it is now known has seen a slow but steady growth under the Pelley administration. Whilst the President has suspended any new publications on the matter to avoid First Amendment cases, prior works such as the Golden Scripts are being sold in higher numbers and more and more people seem open to exploring the President's ideas on not just politics and economics, but spirituality as well. Of course, this has also caused ridicule from papers such as the L.A. Times who mock Pelley as a 'guru', making many in the party reluctant to push the matter further."

unionstate.59.d:0 "It is no secret that the President is the most powerful man in these United States, but even a powerful man at times has need for favors and assistance. In the years before he assumed the Presidency Pelley acquired a long list of contacts in several fields, particularly in finance, industry and politics, through his authorship followed by his leadership of the Silver Legion. Whilst our programs are being speedily implemented and the Chiefs vision of America becomes truer by the day it might be wise to call in these favors and outstanding debts, even if it might appear unpopular to the masses."

unionstate.5900.t:0 "The Ward System"
unionstate.5900.d:0 "Due to his campaign promises, the Pelley administration is faced with a controversial idea that needs resolved. In the past, now President Pelley spoke of a system that in his eyes would allow the government to best help and uplift its most impoverished citizens. Known as the Ward System, the idea would see those Americans identified as most impoverished (particularly Appalachian whites, deep southern blacks and Mexican immigrants) become Wards of the state and be brought under its care. However, Pelley identifies these elements as the most unproductive in society and would deny them full Commonwealth benefits, relegating them to largely labor jobs. While in theory the system would be used to educate these peoples and ensure they can enter the Commonwealths workforce on an equal footing some have expressed outrage and compared the idea to modern slavery. The President calls these claims outrageous and a step forward from the old Jim Crow system but a choice must be made on the matter immediately, with challenges by ACLU and NAACP lawyers as well as the opposition parties making the mainstream of the CP more reluctant to endorse it."

unionstate.5901.t:0 "Cleansing Hollywood"
unionstate.5901.d:0 "Before entering the realms of either spirituality or politics, Pelley was a rather successful screenwriter for Hollywood and while he eventually grew disgusted with the industry and its supposed Syndicalist influence he has always maintained a fondness for the silver screen, and in turn it began to despise him. Recently the President organized a showing of several of the films he helped make in his heyday at the White House and afterwards he announced a number of executive orders seeking to cleanse Hollywood of any anti-American sentiments and sponsoring the opening of new studios so that Americans may once again enjoy cinema if Hollywood did not 'clean up its act' at once. Much of the right-wing of the CP is pushing for him to simply implement these policies now however and Pelley would prefer it that way, although many in the cabinet view it as too radical."

unionstate.5902.t:0 "The First Americans"
unionstate.5902.d:0 "Is there any group more disadvantaged and stepped on in the modern United States than its original inhabitants? President Pelley certainly doesn’t think that’s the case, having for several years written about the plights of various Indian groups and peoples and the attempts by various groups to seize their lands or turn them to beliefs like Syndicalism in an effort to manipulate them. In a recent speech to Congress the President swore that these transgressions would end now and forever, promising to strengthen and strongly enforce the treaties the Federal Government has with the Indian Nations and ensure these groups have equal opportunities under the Commonwealth system."

Thus far, O'Daniel's attempts to reach out to big businesses both within the Union State and without have been met with failure. Businessmen have shown distaste for the faction representing the same populist values of men like William Jennings Bryan and "Fighting Bob" La Follette Sr., and O'Daniel will have to work hard to make such men feel comfortable in the country. To do so, we have a range of options. We could further cut taxes on businesses, encouraging them to come to Great Plains states, in particular Texas. However, such cuts may be unpopular with other parties and allow them to cut into our support base. We could also target certain industries, from finance to construction to the oil industry, in the hopes of increasing their interest in our country.

His five points include $40 million in new revenue, the abolition of the poll tax and of capital punishment, the appointment of a state-appointed budget director, and an amendment banning deficit spending. Though he was initially optimistic about the passage of the entire plan, it met some opposition from left-wingers in the AFP and the NPP who claimed that it was nowhere near enough to solve the current crisis. Further, while the Christian Party largely supported the proposals, Gerald K. Smith and other right-wing AFP members opposed the legislation, with some arguing it was too liberal and others arguing it went against everything Huey Long had fought for. As such, we may need to cut some of the proposals from the bill, but which proposals should be cut?"

As such, he has been eager to push this proposal and codify it into law, but it seems that his political inexperience has limited him in this pursuit. O'Daniel failed to even gain the support of some of his fellow Texan congressmen, with the questions of how this pension system will be funded still unclear. For his part, the Texan leader is apparently frustrated at this setback, but he pledges to carry on with his agenda nonetheless. Instead of an old-age pension system, he has instead begun to formulate a plan for post-war America, in which pensions will be granted to veterans as a way of easing the country, or more acurately, his fellow politicians, into the idea of pensions for all elderly citizens. This "Dependent and Disability Act" will be just what O'Daniel needs to push old-age pensions forward."
unionstate.5905.a:0 "Crooked politicians!"

unionstate.5906.t:0 "The Dependent and Disability Act Passes"
unionstate.5906.d.pappy:0 "The events of today were the culmination of years of planning on the part of W. Lee O'Daniel. Today, a form of O'Daniel's proposed pension program has been passed through Congress, and it is popular enough now that though he has largely abandoned any hope for pensions, his people cry out for them as a necessary form of relief. The most difficult part in passing the act was finding the source of funding for it, but due to his high popularity, he was able to force the implementation of a 1.6% tax on business transactions into law, providing more than enough funding for this program. O'Daniel does not plan to stop here, and in fact, he hopes to renew his push for elderly pensions as well. Time will tell whether this proposal succeeds, however."
unionstate.5906.d.other:0 "Today, the Dependent and Disability Act was officially codified into law. The successful passage of the act marks a victory for [TEX.GetLeader], who had helped push for this act as a way of thanking the patriotic veterans who made victory possible for the Union State. Now, veterans will get the relief they deserve."
unionstate.5906.a:0 "They deserve the money more than any!"

unionstate.5907.t:0 "Repay the Hillbilly Boys"
unionstate.5907.d:0 "Pappy O'Daniel's "Hillbilly Boy" band was instrumental in getting him elected as leader of the American Union State. Now, with his position secure, the members of the band expect some sort of reward for their loyalty, and O'Daniel is happy to give it to them. However, we must decide how we wish to go about this. We could grant them even more power in the government than they currently hold, meaning more positions for them in the cabinet. Alternatively, we could make them fabuously wealthy, and keep sending them on tours around the country. Do we need these men in government, or around the country?"
unionstate.5907.a:0 "Bring them home!"
unionstate.5907.b:0 "Send them out to boost morale!"

unionstate.5908.t:0 "Economy in Government"
unionstate.5908.d:0 "One of W. Lee O'Daniel's promises was to bring "economy to government". By this, he did not mean that the government would be more concerned with economic issues. Instead, he meant that the corrupt politicians in Texas, the Great Plains, and the country as a whole had used spending they promised to their people for their own gain or purposes, while the people suffered under their rule. One of the worst instances of this misuse was last week, when O'Daniel was informed that $1 million for oprhanages was instead being siphoned off to pay for party machine costs. Another instance was when $3 million meant to help buy new tanks apparently disappeared, and such instances are not uncommon. O'Daniel believes this wasteful spending to be distasteful, inefficient, and worst of all, immoral. However, to get the spending of our government officials back on track, should we..."
unionstate.5908.a:0 "Make sure the military is efficient"
unionstate.5908.b:0 "Hold politicians to their promises" 

unionstate.5909.t:0 "Tax Law Controversy"
unionstate.5909.d:0 "From the very beginnings of his political career, Pappy O'Daniel has had a desire to slice taxes for his people and give them the ability to spend again. However, he has met significant opposition from the left in this endeavor. Mainstream Longists have protested that such cuts, particularly on the wealthy, would go against the ideals of Huey Long. Meanwhile, those in the NPP argue that these tax cuts are merely an excuse to make the Union State more attractive to wealthy investors. O'Daniel has not denied this charge, happy to admit that he wants more investment in Texas and the country as a whole, and he has even shot back that anyone who does not want such investment is as bad as the politicians who got us into this crisis to begin with. \n\nRhetoric aside, though, it is apparent that O'Daniel will have a hard time forcing his ideal tax laws through without tweaking them. Should we decide to cut poll taxes, we will surely gain the support of leftists and the common people, while slicing taxes on businesses will likely bring more investment in our economy, regardless of the state of the nation's politics or military."
unionstate.5909.a:0 "Cut poll taxes!"
unionstate.5909.b:0 "Tax relief for businesses!"

unionstate.5910.t:0 "An Opportunity Arises!"
unionstate.5910.d:0 "With the war over and O'Daniel's programs beginning to win the hearts and minds of Americans, it is a better time than ever to attempt to push for the fifth part of O'Daniel's five-point plan. It may seem like a minor detail to some, including O'Daniel himself, but his supporters will hold him to it. If we can push this legislation through Congress, O'Daniel will be remembered for both reconstruction and his own plans. Should we move forward with this policy?"
unionstate.5910.a:0 "Yes, do it!"
unionstate.5910.b:0 "There is no need..."

unionstate.5911.t:0 "Our National Flag"
unionstate.5911.d:0 "With Pappy O'Daniel in charge of the country, it may be high time for a new flag. There are many possibilities in consideration, with all of them having one form or another of Texan influence to them. On the other hand, we could keep our current flag. What should we do?"

unionstate.5912.t:0 "Collected Western Stories of Robert E. Howard"
unionstate.5912.d:0 "The current revival of American culture has been followed by the renaissance of Westerns as a genre of literature. One interesting case of this is a collection of short stories by Texas writer R. E. Howard, which have just been released. These stories, like 'The Pride of Bear Creek' or 'Pistol Politics', focus on describing adventurous life in the American Frontier. Stories about gunslingers such as the Sonora Kid are especially popular in this genre, appealing to a wide swath of readers. This does not mean, however, that the author wrote Western stories only in this narrowly understood subgenre. Literary works such as the adventures of the Texan traveler Francis Xavier Gordon in 'The Coming of El Borak', 'Hawk of the Hills' or 'The Country of the Knife' or even horrors stories such as 'Black Canaan'  or 'Pigeons from Hell' are all part of the Western genre, even if they are less traditional. Meanwhile, the popularity of Howard's Westerns is now so great that no one remembers the rest of the literary attempts to create other pulp heroes, such as the boring Conan the Barbarian or the naive puritan Solomon Kane."
unionstate.5912.a:0 "Robert E. Howard will be remembered as the Father of Westerns"

unionstate.5913.t:0 "Racial Segregation in Trade Unions"
unionstate.5913.d:0 "Until recently, the demands of some trade unions were too far-reaching. Postulates of non-American and non-Christian initiatives, probably inspired by immigrant conspirators from syndicalist Europe, are not only a threat to American values but also harmful to the entire economic system. These includes issues such as desegregation in workplaces or the equalization of wages of White and Colored workers. The abolition of the unions would, of course, be harmful, as it would leave workers vulnerable to crooked politicians. A promising solution to this problem was proposed as early as 1924, by the unionist Samuel Gompers. He claimed that 'the Caucasians are not going to let their standard of living be destroyed by Negroes, Chinamen, Japs, or any other...If the colored man continues to lend himself to the work of tearing down what the White man has built up, a race hatred worse than any ever known before will result.' For this reason, he suggested creating separate trade unions only for White Americans. Keeping blacks from joining trade unions would increase the influence of Whites in the government by strengthening the power of the workers' strike. Interestingly, even the extremist William Z. Foster had such remarks in the past. In 1920 he called blacks 'a race of strikebreakers'. So a firm decision must be made. Will we maintain segregation in the new trade unions or allow racially mixed unions to function?"
unionstate.5913.a:0 "Compulsory racial segregation in trade unions is the right thing to do"
unionstate.5913.b:0 "We will not restrict the freedom of association"

unionstate.5914.t:0 "Curriculum at American Universities"
unionstate.5914.d:0 "Universities are forging our young minds. As such, they are an important institution for the next generation. However, academics in our country must not be infected with anti-American or subversive thought. Some academics in fields such as social sciences, anthropology and the humanities have been known to transmit progressive and even harmful ideas to their students. Some even see a sinister influence in fields such as modern physics or biological sciences. The simple fact is that free and uncontrolled universities can become hotspots for subversive thought under the pretext of academic freedom. To combat this, Pappy O'Daniel plans to put favorable representatives on the Universities Regents Councils to control what is taught. Although some criticize this project, others, including Coke Stevenson, even encouraged more radical action including the removal of defiant professors."
unionstate.5914.a:0 "Let us introduce trusted people to university authorities"
unionstate.5914.b:0 "No, academic freedom must not be violated"

unionstate.60.d:0 "Black Legion leader Virgil Effinger has been captured by our forces after the military uncovered his hideout and forced him and his bodyguards to surrender. Now, Effinger and his top men are going to be tried by our government but the attorney general is asking us if we should pursue the death penalty or not? While some activists in our ranks would prefer to stick to our anti-death penalty stance most everyone else believes we should favor the death penalty. Since Effinger will absolutely be convicted this will decide his fate."
unionstate.60.a:0 "Pursue the Death Penalty"

unionstate.61.d:0 "With the Plumb Plan being enacted [TEX.GetLeader] cut the red tape on the ATSF railway in Wisconsin to symbolize a new railroad that is run by both the owners, workers and public. While initially costly to implement this is a widely popular event and has seen many Americans looking forward to a new America, and many unions among affected railroads viewing liberal reforms as superior to syndicalist policy."
unionstate.61.a:0 "Great"

unionstate.62.t:0 "Endorse Deweyism?"
unionstate.62.d:0 "John Dewey was a member of the social patriots in the CSA but who was sympathetic to us and repeatedly pushed for peace with the American Union State, and many of his adherents were among our own ranks as well. As such, his followers believe we should take the opportunity of refitting the education system to apply his theories of hands off teaching and self-learning to our schools, which they believe will better prepare our children to become citizens. Traditional teachers of course oppose the model."

unionstate.63.t:0 "Long criticizes the NPP!"
unionstate.63.d:0 "Huey Long has come out against 'sewer socialism', arguing that it does not go far enough to redistribute wealth while also leaving too much power in bureaucrats who do not represent the 'will of the people'. We have replied with accusations of Long's corruption but he has struck a chord among those who believe Long would have gone further to combat economic inequality although our economists believe it would have been for show."
unionstate.63.a:0 "Bastard!"

unionstate.64.t:0 "Black Support?"
unionstate.64.d:0 "The NAACP is petitioning us to make an effort to support black workers by removing racical barriers in being hired for our government programs and organizing them within our farmer-labor groupings. This has naturally caused ambivalance in the party despite many progressives favoring such measures, some are still nervous this could lead to a backlash and note that our black support during the election was not particularly high anyways."

unionstate.66.t:0 "Large Contractors Offer Help"
unionstate.66.d:0 "While we promised to favor smaller contractors for our projects, the Kiewit Corporation has just made a very lucrative offer to help rebuilding Nebraska alongside our government. This would be much more efficient and quick than assembling many small contractors, and would see the state back on its feet in no time. However, Nebraska contractors would of course see this as a betrayal, even if we tried to have Kiewit work with them."

The organisation's shareholders consist of members of the AFP, the Prohibiton Party, and the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. These board members met at 2am, straddling the line between official business and secrecy. William Upshaw, of the Prohibtion Party, brought to the fore President Long's apparent betrayal of his party values. The AFP board members agreed that Long's rejection of a main campaign promise bodes ill for more 'morally-centred' legislation in the future. Francis Townsend, who joined Huey Long in order to push his Old-Age Revolving Pension Plan, agreed it was necessary to elect a new representative for the Share Our Wealth program, someone who wouldn't be beholden to the president's whims. After much debate, it was decided that newly-elected Louisiana Congressman, Gerald L.K. Smith, is far enough removed from Long yet still dedicated to social security. As the votes were tallied in Smith's favour, the board pondered what Smith's association with the Silver Legion might mean in the future..."

unionstate.78.d:0 "After the end of hostilities in Washington, a large section of the conservative Democratic Party pledged their alligence to [Root.GetNameDef] and to the ideals President Long follows. Implicitly, these Democrats hoped Long would fulfil their desires for more state power in exchange for allowing Long's economic reforms to easily pass. This unwritten promise was broken when Long denied them the ability to enforce Prohibition, going so far as to ignore their impassioned speeches in favour of repealing the Interstate Commerce Act. Many conservative Democrats now see the AFP's regime as merely a sham democracy that rejects any measure the Long political machine will not personally benefit from. The President was still shocked, however, when the halls of Congress were only 3/4 full this week. Currently legislation is frozen, and it appears the so-called Dixiecrats are taking all their vacation days at once."

unionstate.79.t:0 "The Officers' Revolt"
unionstate.79.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to incentivise officers to remain in their positions during this very sensivite time, approximately one hundred army officers have expressed deep reservations for Huey Long's trial. The press has reported these dissenting opinions, and thus have also given us warning of the officers' coming protest in the capital in five day's time. We have no illusions these marchers will be peaceful, or that their march won't culminate in a demand for the Silver Legion to return power to the AFP. General Patton, still leading the Fifth Army, has promised he will protect our right to rule the Commonwealth. Giving him free reign against the marchers, however, will be a bloody battle that could easily backfire on us. Richard Butler has suggested instead having Legion supporters infiltrate the marcher ranks and disrupt them from within. Better to make the officers look unreasonable and foolish than to make the government appear tyrannical."

unionstate.80.t:0 "Rebuilding the Constitution"
unionstate.80.d:0 "The Dixiecrats, who we tipped off about the 'arrest' of Long, have been useful in maintaining the facade that is Congress. The tedious proccess of replacing state representatives with Legionaries has meant that we have become more and more reliant on the Dixiecrats remaining content in the meantime. After a recent push by Chief Pelley to pass Amendments 22-24, bringing in a new "Grandfather" clause -depriving people of rights not enjoyed by their grandfather- and requiring a profession of faith in order to serve in Congress, the agenda has turned to Pelley's final amendment: reserving private and government land for redistribution to Christians. This has spawned a surprise backlash. The Dixiecrats claim this eminent domain impedes the rights of states to their own land, something Huey Long promised he wouldn't do. Chief Pelley is now in a bind. If he gives into the Dixiecrats, it will make him look weak at the very time he needs to look like he has all the answers. If he strongarms the amendment, as many of his advisers suggest, it dispels the illusion of democracy we so dearly need to maintain."

unionstate.101.t:0 "The Future of Warfare"
unionstate.101.d:0 "After a long reshuffling of former US departments, the American Union State has uncovered old classified weapons proposals. The two proposals that caught the most interest are ones authored by Robert Goddard and Vannevar Bush, each proposing an expensive weapon project to deter invasions. Fortunately, both men were recovered from their respective hiding places, and persuaded into updating their proposals. Goddard's plan is for a liquid fuel rocket to deliver stable explosive payloads across long distances. Vannevar Bush's is a theoretical utilisation of nuclear fission to create a bomb based on experiments done in Europe. Which plan should we pursue?"

At the head is a lower tonnage explosive meant to detonate after a set amount of time spent flying. A successful arc and explosion turns the New Mexico skyline on fire."

It began with a dearth of willing physicists and nuclear experts including Robert Oppenheimer who has yet to be located. Several other potential candidates signed a Humanist Declaration of pacifism abroad declaring their opposition to our program. Therefore, Bush has had to resort to industrial technicians which extended the timeline. Finally, after much testing and assistance from George Kistiakowsky, the first atomic bomb is tested. Due to the extensive safety precautions take, the vital test yielded an impressive blast but poor documentation."

There is a longing among many to return to the stability of the Stars and Stripes, even if things have irrevocably changed.

A second Declaration of Independence was drafted in Baton Rouge over the course of a few days, painstakingly emulating the original conceit of the American Revolution. This declaration outlined the lack of protection the federal government gave to citizens, and the role of the state to protect the welfare of the poor.

Many notable figures were in attendance, such as Texas Governor James Allred, Alabama Governor Bibb Graves, Wisconsin Governor Philip LaFollette and his brother Senator Robert LaFollette Jr. along with many other representatives from other loyal states. Aware of the growing determination to defy the federal government, and that this lack of willingness to negotiate meant civil war was all but certain, a large number of politicians have slinked away to the west... though those that remain seem more determined than ever to see victory."

#AUS's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

TEX_CLAIRE_LEE_CHENNAULT_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 6, 1890, in Commerce, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Claire Lee 'Old Leatherface' Chennault began his military career when he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps while he attended the Louisiana State University. He graduated from the Officers' School at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana in 1917, and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the Army Signal Corps soon after. He earned his wings in 1919 and remained in service after the air branch was turned into the Air Corps. In 1931, he became Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School, and would take charge of the 1st Pursuit Group of Alabama's Aerobatic Team, becoming a regional celebrity of his aerial feats. As 1937 loomed over, Chennault was considering resignation as the staff in Washington refused to promote him beyond Captain, considering him unfit for duty due to his declining health. When the American Civil War began, Chennault sided with the former Governor of Louisiana, giving Huey a small hike in recruitment as passionate observers of Chennault's performances filled the recruiting booths, and in exchange, Huey granted Chennault the honorary rank of Brigadier General for his service to the American Union State\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His health has been slowly deteriorating, with deafness and chronic bronchitis being the main issues Chennault will have to face sooner or later."
TEX_DADDY_COLLINS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joseph Lawton 'Lightning Joe' Collins began his military career in 1913 when he joined West Point thanks to an alternate appointment his uncle Martin Behrman, the major of New Orleans at the time, managed to get him at the age of 17 and graduated as an infantry second lieutenant in 1917. He'd stay as a teacher in West Point and marry Gladys Easterbrook in his time at the academy. In 1921, he began teaching Chemistry in West Point as well and in 1926, he graduated from the company officer course at the Infantry School in Fort Benning. A year later, he'd undergo and successfully complete an advanced course at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. After that, Collins taught weapons and tactics at the Infantry School from 1927 to 1932 where he requested a transfer to the Philippine Division from 1933 to 1934 and became a major. In 1935 and 1936, he graduated from Army Industrial College and the Army War College reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. \n§YImportant Notes:§W- An extremely talented yet aggressive commanding officer, his skills shine the most when leading an attack on the enemy rather than playing on the defence."
TEX_COURTNEY_HODGES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 05 January, 1887, in Houston County, Georgia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Courtney Hicks Hodges began his military career when he joined West Point in 1904, but was forced to drop out a year later due to his extremely poor academic performance. Undeterred, he enlisted in the army in 1906 as a private, where he quickly rose to the rank of sergeant in 1907 and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in 1909. He joined Pershing during the Punitive Expedition, where he met George S. Patton and George Marshall, and would remain in the Mexican border for the rest of the late 1910s, facing off several small skirmisher groups with the 6th Infantry Regiment. After being promoted to Major for his service at the border, he attended the Command and General Staff College, graduating in 1925 and becoming a member of the Infantry Board at Fort Benning. In 1934, graduated from the Army War College, earning him his promotion to lieutenant colonel."
TEX_WILLIAM_SIMPSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 18, 1888, at Weatherford, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W In June 1905, a month after turning 17, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated four years later in June 1909, being commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Infantry Branch. Simpson's first assignment was with the 6th Infantry Regiment at Fort Lincoln, North Dakota. Soon afterwards the regiment was sent overseas to Mindanao, in the Philippines, in January 1910 and remained there for another two-and-a-half years, where Simpson participated in the suppression of the Moro Rebellion. He returned to the United States with his regiment in 1912 and, being stationed at Fort Bliss, remained there as a company commander until, now promoted to first lieutenant, he fought in Pershing's Punitive Expedition in 1916. In February 1917 he became aide-de-camp to Major General George Bell, Jr., who commanded the El Paso Military District. Since 1919, Simpson has filled several staff appointments and attended military schools and courses and would be promoted in early 1921 to Captain. Simpson served with the General Staff until 1932 where he began teaching military science and tactics at Pomona College until 1936, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1934. As the country spiralled out of control, Simpson became more and more aligned with Huey Long's vision of America as time passed, and when Huey finally proclaimed the American Union State, Simpson presented his services to what he sees as the true American government. For his loyalty, Simpson was turned into a brigadier general."
TEX_JACOB_DENVERS_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 8 September 1887, in York, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Devers began his military career when Congressman Daniel F. Lafean offered him an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1906 and graduated on 11 June 1909 as an artillery second lieutenant. Devers' first posting was to the 1st Battalion, 4th Mountain Artillery in Washington and for his next assignment in late 1912, Devers was sent back to West Point to teach mathematics. On 1 April 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and he was transferred to the newly activated 9th Field Artillery at the Schofield Barracks in Hawaii and promoted to Captain in early 1917. In May 1919, Devers was sent on a three-month temporary duty assignment to study the Weltkrieg in Europe. He attended the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin to study the equipment and tactics used by both sides during the Weltkrieg. He was promoted to major on 1920 and he was later selected to attend the Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1925. He was then posted to Fort Sill as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929 where Devers was transferred to Washington, D.C., to serve on the staff of the Chief of Field Artillery. In 1932, he was chosen to attend the Army War College and graduated on June 1933. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 26 February 1934. With the country spiraling into Civil War, Devers found himself fighting more and more against his superiors inability to react to internal issues, starting a deep rivalry between him and Dwight Eisenhower, even putting him at odds with his old friend Leslie McNair. When Huey Long declared the Union State, Devers decided that MacArthur and his staff was a liability for America, and promptly volunteered for the AUS officer corp, where he was promoted to Field Marshal along with Terry De La Mesa Sr."
TEX_TERRY_DE_LA_MESA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 1 April 1888, in Fort Douglas, Utah, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Allen was born into a family with a long tradition of military service. His grandfater, Colonel Carlos Alvarez de la Mesa, was a Spanish immigrant who fought for the Union in the Civil War. His father, Colonel Samuel Allen, also served in the military. In 1907, Allen was appointed to West Point in New York. Eventually, this would end in failure primarily due to a stutter, and Allen was kicked out of the school. However, after a successful education at the Catholic University of America, he got a second chance at a military career, and become a second lieutenant of the U.S. Cavalry assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia. Over the years, he has slowly climbed the ranks, and a freak accident that saw him shot in the jaw caused his stutter to disappear. While moving up the chain of command, Allen continued his military education at various institutions, from the U.S. Army Cavalry School and U.S. Army Command School, both in Kansas, to the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He would continue his career as an instructor and eventually met George C. Marshall Jr., who promoted him to the rank of brigadier general. Though he skipped the rank of Colonel that his familial predecessors had had, he did not mind, his focus being on the battlefield first and foremost. In fact, many have compared him to General George S. Patton in his approach to warfare, as his aggressive style and colorful style make him very similar to the more famous man. However, the two differ outside of those factors, as Allen cares little for his appearance and more for tactics, emphasizing night assaults and unpredictable plans. His confident, efficient style of leadership has given him one of the most promising careers in the U.S. Army. Or it did, until 1936, when Major General Omar Bradley clashed with Allen and caused Allen to flee west to the familiar state of Texas, where he had met his wife and served some of his first years of military service. There, he joined Huey Long's cause, and Long, recognizing his talent and high rank, immediately promoted him to the rank of Field Marshal alongside Jacob Denvers."
TEX_MATTHEW_RIDGWAY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 3, 1895, in Fort Monroe, Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Matthew Bunker 'Old Iron Tits' Ridgway began his military career in 1913 when he successfully passed the entrance exam to West Point after failing the year prior. He graduated from the academy in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. Ridgway was first assigned to patrol duty in the Mexican border with the 3rd Infantry Regiment, where he reached the rank of Captain and would return to West Point in 1920 as a Spanish teacher. In 1925, Ridgway graduated from the United States Army Infantry School, after which he was sent to the American Legation in Tianjin and later sent to Nicaragua, where he was one of the American COs trying to supervise the 1927 elections. In 1930, he'd be transferred to the Philippines, where he became an advisor to the Governor-General of the islands and would return to America in 1933 as a Major. He'd graduate from the Army Command and General Staff School in 1935 and was attending the Army War College in Pennsylvania before the Civil War broke out. With the ever increasing radicalisation, he found himself being harassed several times by 'workers' militias' and slowly began losing faith in the Federal Government. When Huey Long finally proclaimed the American Union State, Ridgway decided it was best to leave for the AUS if that was necessary to save America from anarchy, where he was promoted to Brigadier General."
TEX_BRUCE_CLARKE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 29, 1901, in Adams, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Bruce Cooper Clarke joined the National Guard in 1918, where he earned an appointment to the United States Military Academy in 1920. He graduated from West Point in 1925 as a second lieutenant of the engineer corps, and in the same year, he'd earn his civil engineering degree and a bachelor of laws degree, serving mostly on staff roles until he was promoted to Colonel in 1935."
TEX_HENRY_HODES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 19, 1899, in Washington D.C., United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Irving Hodes began his military career when he joined the United States Military Academy, from where he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1920. After fulfilling a series of staff roles, mainly in Wyoming and Texas, he found himself strongly advocating for the mechanization of the American Army along with Patton, which due to the army budget cuts, it became nothing more than a pipe dream for them."
TEX_CLIFTON_CATES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 31, 1893, in Tiptonville, Tennessee, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Clifton Bledsoe 'Lucky' Cates began his military career after graduating from the Missouri Military Academy in 1910 as a second lieutenant for the Marine Corps Reserves. His excellent performance in drills and his qualifications caught the attention of the then Brigadier General George Barnett, who took Cates as his aide-de-camp. Cates would serve with Barnett until 1923, where Cates, who was now a Captain, was assigned to command the Marine detachment in the USS Arizona. In 1928, he was transferred to the to the 4th Marine Regiment in San Diego which would be transferred to guard the American Legation in Shanghai. He returned to America in 1932, where he signed up for the Army Industrial College and the Senior Officer Course of the Marine Corps, graduating in 1935 and reaching the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He'd return to Shanghai in 1936, but would take his leave in late March 1937. As the country spiraled into Civil War, Cates was visiting his family in Tennessee. Seeing the chaos in his hometown, which had been ravaged by a fire when he was young, Cates decided to join the American Union State and convinced his colleague Lewis Puller to join him, becoming a Brigadier General for the AUS Marine Corps, and along with 'Chesty' Puller, one of the most important Marine commanders of the American Union State."
TEX_CHESTY_PULLER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 26, 1898, in West Point, Virginia, United States of America \n§YMilitary Career:§W Lewis Burwell "Chesty" Puller decided to sign up in the army at an early age but was refused because he couldn't get parental consent to join. Until he became 21, he decided to study in the Virginia Military Institute, and after graduating in 1919, he attended the non-commissioned officer school and Officer Candidates School of the Marine Corps, earning the rank of second lieutenant. In 1921, he was assigned to the Gendarmerie d'Haiti and would see over forty skirmishes fighting the Caco rebels and becoming adjutant to Alexander Vandegrift. After four years of serving in garrison duty in the United States, he'd be assigned to the Marine detachment in the Nicaraguan National Guard in December 1928. In Nicaragua, he led several engagements against the Sandinista forces, where he was able to prevail despite being outnumbered significantly by the Nicaraguan rebels, and earning the Navy Cross medal. He returned to the United States in 1931, and completed the Company Officers Course at Fort Benning which he had left pending in 1928, graduating in June 1932 as a Captain and returning to Nicaragua in September. There, he took part in the Battle of El Sauce, where he earned his promotion to Major. He'd be then transferred to command the 'China Marines' in Shanghai in 1933 and would return to America in June 1936 to serve as an as an instructor at The Basic School. With the nation spiralling into Civil War, Puller was persuaded by Cates to join the American Civil War as Puller was indecisive as to who to support. With his arrival at Louisiana, Puller's actions in Nicaragua and Haiti had earned the respect of many members of the staff and Huey Long's cabinet, who pushed for his promotion to Brigadier General."
TEX_PEDRO_DEL_VALLE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 28, 1893, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, United States of America \n§YMilitary Career:§W Pedro Augusto del Valle began his military career after receiving an appointment to attend Anapolis by the appointed governor of Puerto Rico at the time, George Radcliffe Colton.
