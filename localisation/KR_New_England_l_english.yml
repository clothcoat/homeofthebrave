### Parties ###
NEE_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
NEE_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - Essentially an extension of the CSA, the Totalist members of the New England SPA want for workers to unite with the Combined Syndicates of America or, it fails, take up its mantle. The Totalist faction of the SPA is notable for having heavier utopian 'Communist' and Bolshevik influence than other Totalists and often reject National Totalism. Nonetheless like the rest of New England SPA they are thought to be too weak to hold power on their own and would surely simply desire to see the CSA annex the territory."
NEE_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
NEE_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America  -  Essentially an extension of the CSA, the syndicalist members of the New England SPA want for workers to unite with the Combined Syndicates of America or, it fails, take up its mantle. The While usually orthodox members of the IWW or anarchist Utopians, like the rest of New England SPA they are thought to be too weak to hold power on their own and would surely simply desire to see the CSA annex the territory."
NEE_radical_socialist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
NEE_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - Essentially an extension of the CSA, the 'Old Guard' members of the New England SPA were once relative moderates who were pushed somewhat left by the Wilson administrations crackdowns and now support cautiously uniting with the Combined Syndicates of America. Their craft union base and more mild positions (by SPA standards) make them more palitable to much of New England and usually their de facto representatives the in the region for that very reason, however like the rest of the New England SPA they are thought to be too weak to hold power on their own and would surely simply desire to see the CSA annex the territory"
NEE_social_democrat_party:0 "National Party"
NEE_social_democrat_party_long:0 "National Party - The newly-formed National Party is made up of disgruntled Republican and Democratic voters, as well as some independents, who typically agree with the party's progressive platform. The National Party has made various appeals to both farmers and industrial workers, hoping to implement a form of crop insurance and to break monopolies. Eventually, one of the party's goals is to have full employment, so as to combat the Great Depression. The party's rising stars include George Aiken and Frances Perkins, and these figures hope to guide New England through this troubled time."
NEE_social_liberal_party:0 "Liberal Republican Party"
NEE_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Liberal Republican Party - When the Intervention occurred, the Republican Party in New England was nearly destroyed. Now, as party officials attempt to put the pieces back together, there are increasing tensions over the party platform. Those more socially liberal-minded members of the party have split from the main party and are now calling themselves the Republican Party, though others have come to term them the "Liberal Republican Party". William Averall Harriman is the party standardbearer for the time being, but others have emerged in hopes of challenging him in the long term. Herbert H. Lehman, John Gilbert Winant, and powerful politician Thomas Dewey all hope to gain a spot at the head of the party, but time will tell to see which of these men will earn it. In the meantime, the party's espousal of education, a program of Social Security, and anti-corruption has made them popular with New Englanders, but with a split party, they may encounter difficulties in winning an election outright."
NEE_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
NEE_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party - The battered Republican Party has started to re-form, but it is not the same party that existed before. Now, more laissez-faire minded liberals in the party argue with those who are more in favor of government intervention and social policy. The divide has caused a split in the party, and now the laissez-faire wing, represented first and foremost by Percival P. Baxter, finds itself alone. Baxter leads the party for now, but in the upcoming elections, he will face challenges from Hamilton Fish III, Joseph William Martin Jr., and Christian Herter, all fairly unknown politicians. Any of the three could rise in prominence in coming years however, and the path the party takes may depend on who leads it, and what happens to the other faction of the Republican Party. For now, the Republicans must face a united Democratic Party in the coming races, and will struggle to maintain power in many parts of New England."
NEE_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
NEE_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party of New England is both renowned and infamous for it's extreme reliance on political machines (even by the standards of the rest of the nation), mainly the ones in Massachusetts and urban regions. With a strong working class, Catholic and immigrant voter base they semi-openly promote using the patronage system for the public good and often argue it allows a way for the common man to have more direct ties with political leaders through their local machines. Recently they have taken the most moderate stance towards foreign policy with regards to other parties, seemingly wanting to unite America if the opportunity arises but otherwise wanting to stay out of the war, and only maintaining relations with the Entente if it's useful. However given their non-ideological nature all are aware this could change in the future."
NEE_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "The Federalist Party"
NEE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "The Federalist Party - The Federalist Party did not begin as such, being made up of those in the parties (and business) who favored closer ties with Canada and looking upon them for protection. Lead largely by American 'aristocrats' of Anglo-Saxon descent such as the Vanderbilt and Astor families, the 'The Committee to Defend America and the Crown' gradually merged with pro-Canadian business interests in the region until it became the leading pro-Entente group in the nation. Eventually as New England became besieged by syndicalism and the Radical Coalition, heavier political influence was needed and the alliance took the name of the old Federalist Party, a far older New England based party that was likewise pro-British. Viewing Canada as their best hope of beating back syndicalism and enriching New England, the Federalist Party half-expects to be appointed as the leaders of New England by Canada as a reward for their loyalism."
NEE_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "The Remnant"
NEE_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Radical Coalition (The Remnant) - The remnant is named for a loose grouping of activists whom self-identify as old-school radicals, with their intellectual leader being Albert Jay Nock. Often openly skeptical of democracy, the Remnant is nonetheless opposed to state intervention in individual lives except to protect base rights through the justice system. Supported by extremely prominent intellectuals such as H.L. Mencken, the Remnant's middle and upper class supporters have grown in reaction to the perceived failures of the government and their role in destabilizing America, opposing Canadian influence in New England and as a reaction against the growth of populism and socialism, with them having a small volunteer militia to protect their rights from its perceived various enemies. Nonetheless, the Remnant itself is still deeply divided on whether democracy should play in the Republic or if voters supporting interventionism and control is simply too dangerous to liberty."
NEE_national_populist_party:0 "The Sentinels of the Republic"
NEE_national_populist_party_long:0 "Radical Coalition (The Sentinels of the Republic) - The more extreme wing of the Radical Coalition, the Sentinels of the Republic began as a lobbying group fighting virtually all forms of government intervention in the economy in opposition to socialism before going through a series of internal radicalizations in the face of increasingly popular redistribution movements and attacks on the upper-class, influenced by the Remnant and New England's right-wing before adopting Alfred Sloan's arguments for the efficiency of unrestrained capitalism. In recent years the powerful DuPont family has taken charge of the organization, allowing greater Social Darwinist influences and using 'Tuckerist' arguments against not only socialists but even Remnant positions and the state itself which they view as too constraining, something old-school Tuckerists have decidedly mixed feelings about when seeing their positions merged with other Sentinel ones."

NEE_Georgist_Taxation_desc:0 "The Land Value Tax is the only tax in our nation and operates by extracting the full rent from the unimproved value of the land, as estimated by land evaluaters. This overwhelmingly falls on the wealthy and allows for unproductive economic forces such as land speculation to be taxed while not taxing productive activities such as improvements to land or work income.

NEE_Battleline_of_Freedom_desc:0 "We are surrounded by history. From the battlefields of Lexington and Concord, where the first shots of the revolution were fired, to the hallowed halls of Boston.

NEE_armed_beacon_desc:0 "There are two ways we wish to portray our country. For one thing, we are a nation of immigrants and freedom, a beacon of liberty.

NEE_retake_long_island:0 "Retake Long Island"
NEE_retake_long_island_desc:0 "New York should be a part of New England. While we do control upstate New York, Long Island has evaded our control.

NEE_irish_relations:0 "Irish Relations"

NEE_special_relationship:0 "The Special Relationship"
NEE_special_relationship_desc:0 "Can there be a desirable relationship than the one between New England and the British Crown? We are practically their descendents and to this day possess a deeply shared Anglo-Saxon culture and protestant religion, and it was they whom protect us even now from syndicalism and Neo-Confederates.

NEE_powers_of_the_governor:0 "Powers of the Governor"
NEE_powers_of_the_governor_desc:0 "The problem with the old American constitution is that it bestowed too much power on a bickering Congress and not enough on the executive powers that actually allocate resources. The governors of each state will be empowered at the cost of Congress, alongside Mayors and, of course, the President, to give them more control over the public purse."
NEE_third_national_bank:0 "Third National Bank"
NEE_third_national_bank_desc:0 "America has had two national banks and in the case of the second it was dismantled for being too pro-banker. This was fair but times have changed and a national bank would go far in helping control economic instability and the financial system. As such the New England National Bank will be created at once."
NEE_immigrant_aid:0 "Immigrant Aid"
NEE_immigrant_aid_desc:0 "Sadly not all immigrants are treated well when they arrive in our fine nation. Immigrants however can make for fine voters and should be treated as such, so while immigrant rates can't be too high to appease our other voters those poor that do appear should receive brief welfare aid and an easier time finding a job via machine outreach."
NEE_raise_minimum_wage:0 "A Federal Minimum Wage"
NEE_raise_minimum_wage_desc:0 "A federal minimum wage will kill two birds with one stone by making it both more difficult for low-wage workers to undercut union wages while also providing them with higher wages of their own. As such it will help secure our support among the working class while undercutting syndicalism."
NEE_expand_the_machines:0 "Enlarge the Patronage Machine"
NEE_expand_the_machines_desc:0 "With the Democratic Party dominant on the federal level it is time to expand the patronage machine outside of traditional working-class Democratic strongholds by expanding machine politics to new urban regions and even to more rural farmers who can use the machine to gain needed benefits and subsidies as well as creating more middle-class functionaries in the party."

NEE_radical_victory_desc:0 "The syndicalists and loyalists have been pushed back and it's the Radical Coalition between the Freemen (AKA the Remnant) and the Sentinels of the Republic we have to thank for it! They have seized power but ideological differences between the two must be settled if we are to proceed."
NEE_the_remnant:0 "The Remnant"
NEE_the_remnant_desc:0 "The Remnant, a monikor given to the followers of Albert Jay Nock's interpretition of Jeffersonian values, have come out on top of the Constitutional Congress. They promess a minimalist state that only exists to ensure liberty, heavy states rights and deregulation of the economy."
NEE_the_single_tax:0 "A Single Tax"
NEE_the_single_tax_desc:0 "The income tax, the excise tax, the estate tax, is their any end to what governments will take from hard-working citizens?

NEE_nightwatchman_state:0 "Nightwatchman State"
NEE_nightwatchman_state_desc:0 "It is truly disgusting the extent governments attempt to control their citizens for the greater good while encouraging worse vices in the process. It's time to end the long list of arbitrary, moralizing laws against liquor, dancing, prostitution, drugs and other petty regulations for the good of liberty and to focus on fighting theft, fraud and aggression."
NEE_protect_liberty_from_democracy:0 "Defend Liberty from Democracy"
NEE_protect_liberty_from_democracy_desc:0 "We can not allow the populace to be cojouled into voting away their freedoms as so many other states have done! The Bill of Rights must see an expansion that covers economic freedoms related to property owning, trade and greater individual autonomy from government to prevent this, though some will call for us to go a step further."
NEE_decentralized_currency:0 "Decentralized Currency"
NEE_decentralized_currency_desc:0 "The centralization of currency under the federal government after the end of the Articles of Confederation lead to its logical conclusion in the tyrant Wilson created the Federal Reserve. No more! The States now have the right to create their own currency and trade amongst themselves while the Federal Dollar will merely be used to help maintain base neccesities related to military and law enforcement, and placed on a stricter gold standard to keep it in check."
NEE_state_militias:0 "State Militias"
NEE_state_militias_desc:0 "The Federal Government should maintain as small a military as possible as to defend our shores. However, a large military under the federal government could be tyrannical and thus instead we should have the bulk of our forces raised by state militias. They will keep the government in check, encourage civi virtue and their locality to what they're defending will make them harder defenders."
NEE_private_initative:0 "The Pursuit of Happiness"
NEE_private_initative_desc:0 "Government intervention in the economy has caused far more damage than good. Private initiative will pick up where government price distortions leave off, thus granting an opportunity for work and wealth to more private citizens. Likewise, the last remaining red tape shall be slashed, especially with regards to tariffs, arbitrary government standards and regulation of 'public' utilities."
NEE_end_public_schooling:0 "Nockian Education"
NEE_end_public_schooling_desc:0 "The public school system has been an abysmal failure, wasting children's time on pointless tasks and instilling them with federalist propaganda. Any schooling should be up each community that can focus on those with their needs or those with the greatest potential while higher education should be held to as high a standard as possible. No longer shall we finance public schooling."
NEE_jeffersonian_confederacy:0 "Jeffersonian Confederacy"
NEE_jeffersonian_confederacy_desc:0 "It is time to enshrine a real Constitution, one based on Jeffersonianism. The President will be a figurehead of the nation for times of war, Congress dealing with military defense and foreign policy and the vast majority of powers resting with the States, with the final federal economic laws overturned in the process and the state legislatures becoming more political empowered."
NEE_declaration_of_independence:0 "A Declaration of Independence"
NEE_declaration_of_independence_desc:0 "We did not fight off the socialists just to live under the Redcoats! We fought off the loyalists and we can the same to the English monarchy just as we did after 1776 if they are foolish enough to have not learned their lesson the first time and not accept the Second Declaration of Independence."

NEE_the_sentinels_of_the_republic_desc:0 "In a shocking turn of events to the nation the Sentinels of the Republic under Irénée du Pont are now at the helm of our nation! With most of them influenced by variants of Benjamin Tucker's Egoism they promise the destruction of what they view as the final obstacle to freedom, the state itself."
NEE_expand_the_organization:0 "Expand the Organization"
NEE_expand_the_organization_desc:0 "The Sentinels are the last defenders of real liberty in our republic, from threats both domestic and foreign! However, many uninformed citizens are still painfully unaware of this. We should spread the word as widely as possible through radio, pamphlets and even private relations for citizens to join the Sentinels and enjoy the benefits of doing so, especially those productive businessmen who should stand with us against statists."
NEE_private_defense_forces:0 "Private Defense Forces"
NEE_private_defense_forces_desc:0 "The state military system is a failure, being notable disloyal by accepting any government that takes power, a threat to liberty and soaking up absurd amounts of resources. Instead private defense contractors should take their place. While this will shrink the military it still leave the most qualified for fighting, and after corresponding tax cuts the Sentinel Organization will keep in the employ as many military men as it can afford, choosing quality over quantity. Those who desire protection can either pay us or go to another."
NEE_beyond_privatization:0 "Beyond Privatization"
NEE_beyond_privatization_desc:0 "We are not merely going to put an end to tariffs and public utilities as the Freemen propose. No, we will go a step further than that. Yes, the roads and current public goods will be privatized, but alongside them virtually all laws related to economic regulation will be struck down. It is time for the Invisible Hand to take precendence."
NEE_dissolving_the_state:0 "Dissolving the State"
NEE_dissolving_the_state_desc:0 "It is time. The court system, the remnants of public defense, the public police, taxes and the last regulations will be done away with, both at the Federal and state level. The largest monopoly in the land will finally be dismantled and instead man will finally be able to act out his will under true liberty."
NEE_might_makes_right:0 "Right of Might"
NEE_might_makes_right_desc:0 "The Sentinels must protect the new status quo at all costs! Of course, man has a right to either lose or take that land which can not be defended so let us defend it well. The Sentinels will take over lands bordering us that refuse to pay the appropriate protection fees and use it to further fund private defenses against foreign enemies."
NEE_crush_statists:0 "Crush Statists"
NEE_crush_statists_desc:0 "The enemies of liberty have not left us simply because the state is gone. No, our enemies amongst in the Democratic wards, 'liberal' Businessmen, Socialistic Unions and English loyalists are still amongst us. A campaign by the largest military force in the territory, the Sentinels, to strike their organizations and seize their assets, will be a boon to liberty."
NEE_right_of_contract:0 "Right of Contract"
NEE_right_of_contract_desc:0 "While the right to take by force is always on the table, it can be quite costly compared to signing a contract. The Right of Contract is an informal right that allows both ourselves and the people of the New England to settle their differences via signed agreement. While we obviously can not put this into law we can set an example by spreading and honoring our business deals as widely as possible."
NEE_a_fee_for_our_aid:0 "A Fee for our Aid"
NEE_a_fee_for_our_aid_desc:0 "The Canadians insist that we act as a bulwark against syndicalism. While the Syndicalists are considered a great evil we should not simply do their bidding for free. If they and others who are opposed to syndicalism want our aid they should pay for the privilege."
NEE_hostile_takeover:0 "Hostile Takeover"
NEE_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "Some wealthy families, notably the Astors, refuse to join the Sentinels or respect us. They believe Canada or their family guards give them the right to ignore us. If they will put forward their resources to defend the new liberty then we will take over their assets and put it to better use. May the better man win."
NEE_expanded_labor_pool:0 "New Labor Pools"
NEE_expanded_labor_pool_desc:0 "Too many citizens behave as if the old standards are still in place with regards to labor agreements. But with labor freed of government standards all who desire to work can, including most importantly the very young whom have a right to our labor contracts as soon as they are old enough to understand them and sign. We will set a fine example by providing work for these little ones."

NEE_block_foreign_hordes_desc:0 "Our peril is clear: the other races are reproducing at a worrying rate, far faster than that of the Nordics. There is little we can do about this state of affairs, given our own measly power, but we do control our own territory. We must bar these inferior elements, and turn them away. Should we include our own countrymen, however? 
NEE_racial_catalogues:0 "Racial Catalogues"
NEE_racial_catalogues_desc:0 "It is time for a different type of census. We will endeavor to create new racial classifications, established along the lines of Stoddard's previous works, that will divide our society from now on. This will allow for greater ease in purifying our nation at a later date. We also must decide the place of each of these groups, once we have decided how to categorize them."
NEE_embrace_science:0 "Embrace Science"
NEE_embrace_science_desc:0 "For too long, society has been ruled by passion, prejudice, and unreason.

NEE_submarine_effort_desc:0 "An incremental improvement over the previous Porpoise class, they will be the first American submarine class to achieve 21 knots with a reliable propulsion plant, allowing them to operate with the Standard-type battleships of the surface fleet. Their range of over 11.000 Nautical miles also further makes them the prime submarine in operations from the Atlantic to the Pacific."

NEE_US_Airforce:0 "New England Air Force"
NEE_US_Airforce_desc:0 "Although we have little experience with the use of aircraft in military operations, the Weltkrieg has shown its crucial role on the battlefield and years of continued research and development in the field has led to the creation of our own air force. Although untested in battle, our manufacturers have guaranteed us that America has and will always have the best aircraft in the world."

NEE_Air_Defence_Command:0 "Establish Air Defence Command"

NEE_ISAC_Equipement:0 "ISAC Equipment Reliance"
NEE_ISAC_Equipement_desc:0 "The Canadian ISAC initiative has established itself as a veritable authority in the field of armament research and its production capacity and technological knowhow still leave us far behind.

NEE_appoint_chaffee:0 "Father Chaffee"
NEE_appoint_chaffee_desc:0 "Adna R. Chaffee has been an avid horseman his whole life. Now, however, he urges us to embrace the future. Chaffee is specifically concerned with tanks.

NEE_mechanical_cavalry:0 "Mechanical Cavalry"
NEE_mechanical_cavalry_desc:0 "Real wars are fought by real men, not solely by tanks. However, we can still use technology to serve these men.

NEE_coordination_principal:0 "The Coordination Principle"
NEE_coordination_principal_desc:0 "As the foremost power in the world, Germany's military should be something to emulate.

This will greatly aid our inter-branch cooperation and experience."
NEE_experimental_organization:0 "Experimental Divisions"
NEE_experimental_organization_desc:0 "Father Chaffee has relentlessly pressed us to not only modernize our vehicles, but to experiment with new ones.

He is quick to point out that in his day, infantry were the driving force behind armies, and he believes they still are.

He believes that we must re-organize our military in a way that allows them to be more efficient and coordinate quicker. With these things, we can outfox the enemy."
NEE_open_warfare:0 "Open Warfare"
NEE_open_warfare_desc:0 "America is a great expanse, and battles fought on her soil will be different than those fought in Europe. We must be ready for open warfare. Pershing has suggested we follow the Schlieffen model of a quick encirclement of our enemies. Though it may have failed in the Weltkrieg, he believes we have the necessary technology to make that sort of plan a success today."
NEE_natural_defenses:0 "Natural Defenses"
NEE_natural_defenses_desc:0 "New England is a place of varied geography. The Hudson River and the Catskills mountains on our southern border can serve as a natural defense against any who dare cross our border. Pershing has incorporated these natural features into his grand plan, and believes they will not hinder our military, and in fact do just the opposite."
NEE_breakthrough_emphasis:0 "Breakthrough Emphasis"
NEE_breakthrough_emphasis_desc:0 "As a man who has been a senior officer in the military long enough to see the Weltkrieg come and go, General Pershing believes breakthroughs are a crucial part of warfare. His plan, like the German plans all those years ago, does not take enemy defenses into account. But, unlike them, Pershing says we have the technology to get around anything they can throw at us."
NEE_long_range_logistics:0 "Long-Range Logistics"
NEE_long_range_logistics_desc:0 "To win any modern war, we must be prepared for large fronts. With tanks and planes, we can help our army push deep into enemy lines. With better rations, our army will not suffer the fate of Napoleon's Grand Armee. Combined, these factors will allow greater logistical ability than ever before."
NEE_expand_westpoint:0 "Expand Westpoint"
NEE_expand_westpoint_desc:0 "General Pershing graduated from Westpoint over 50 years ago. Despite this, he has never lost his belief in the institution as a necessity for any aspiring officer. Let us expand funding for Westpoint and make sure it is the cutting edge of military training in North America. Our officers are better!"
NEE_american_marksmenship:0 "American Marksmenship"
NEE_american_marksmenship_desc:0 "A well-trained army has scouts, and a well-trained modern army has snipers. It also has soldiers who rarely miss. If our soldiers can be rigorously trained in the pursuit of accurate shots, Pershing argues, we can save ammunition and kill more enemies. How could we argue with that?"
NEE_iron_discipline:0 "Iron Discipline"
NEE_iron_discipline_desc:0 "Though we may not have the manpower or the industrial capacity of our rivals, we have something they can not match. One advantage Pershing insists we have is in the mental state of our men. The discipline of our soldiers will be unmatched, and they will neither break nor surrender. With an unbreakable will and iron discipline, New England will never be beaten."
NEE_merit_promotion:0 "Promotion by Merit"
NEE_merit_promotion_desc:0 "An effective military should always issue promotions based on merit, not bloodline. Such a tradition is deeply American, and is also practiced by the mightiest army on Earth. By emphasizing that anyone with talent can ascend the ranks, we will encourage our brightest and sharpest minds to join our military and serve New England."
NEE_black_combat_troops:0 "Black Combat Training"
NEE_black_combat_troops_desc:0 "Pershing is in favor of a "separate-but-equal" approach to Black soldiers. He has encouraged the creation of all-black units and insists that their training is indeed equal to that of any other soldier. This will encourage Black soldiers from our rivals to flee here, he notes, because they will have more control within their own units. Whether he is right or not is yet to be seen."
NEE_assault_the_line:0 "Assault the Line"
NEE_assault_the_line_desc:0 "Trench Warfare is still relevant today, as it was in the Weltkrieg. Unlike those poor souls, our soliders will not lose their lives fighting for mere feet or even inches of land. Instead, we will make sure we can break any line we face. Pershing insists we show the Europeans (and our rivals) that we are superior to them in this way."

NEE_old_gravel_voice:0 "Old Gravel Voice"
NEE_old_gravel_voice_desc:0 "Ernest N. Harmon is one of our top generals, and he has a distinct plan. He calls it "Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition", and it is a plan that specifically emphasizes artillery bombardment and has a more general focus on equipment production. With a focus on these things, Old Gravel Voice knows that we will blow our enemies to smithereens."
NEE_integrated_armor:0 "Integrated Armor"
NEE_integrated_armor_desc:0 "Tanks are fairly new to warfare, but have similar explosive potential to artillery. Put together, the forces can bring hellfire on our enemy. Though we still need shells and training for these tactics, establishing the plan is the first step to victory. Let us bring armor into the fold."
NEE_decisive_tactics:0 "Tactical Decisiveness"
NEE_decisive_tactics_desc:0 "If there is any lesson that should be learned from the Weltkrieg, it is that the enemy should be destroyed decisively before they have a chance to dig in. To avoid prolonged conflicts, we will invest in aggressive and decisive tactics that allow us to use our superior firepower to our advantage."
NEE_artillery_line:0 "Artillery Offensive"
NEE_artillery_line_desc:0 "Harmon argues that an investment in artillery would go a long way in breaking through to the south, or in any other theater of war. With artillery coming first, the enemy line will be like melted butter, and our infantry will be the knife that slices through it."
NEE_counter_attack:0 "Counter-Attack Bias"
NEE_counter_attack_desc:0 "General Hermon believes that if our men are being pushed back, they should fire with overwhelming artillery force to hold the line and even push the enemy back. In fact, Harmon prefers this strategy, noting it allows the enemy to fall into our artillery's waiting jaws." 
NEE_shore_bombardment:0 "Shore Bombardment"
NEE_shore_bombardment_desc:0 "The sea will not be spared from our wrath. We will rain fire on the coastline of our enemies, destroying their ports and harbors, so that they can never invade our homeland."
NEE_armored_spearhead:0 "Armored Spearhead"
NEE_armored_spearhead_desc:0 "Though he emphasizes use of artillery and airplanes, Hermon is also a strong proponent of armored warfare. He believes that our tanks can punch holes in enemy lines that can be followed up on by planes, artillery, and infantry, in order to overwhelm our enemy. Let us train our men and build our equipment to serve this purpose."
NEE_mechanical_drawing:0 "Westpoint Engineering"
NEE_mechanical_drawing_desc:0 "Westpoint is one of the greatest military institutions in the world, but officers are not the only graduates. There are also engineers with crucial knowledge that could bolster our war effort. Giving more funding to Westpoint and encouraging engineering as a career will help our military overcome some of the greatest annoyances we can encounter in war."
NEE_bombing_support:0 "Bombing Support"
NEE_bombing_support_desc:0 "We shall bomb our enemy into submission until they praise the lord. Airplanes can carry heavier loads than ever before, and Old Gravel Voice insists we use this fact to our advantage. Let us fill the sky with planes and make sure that the enemy is soft for our ground forces."
NEE_firepower_purchase:0 "Heavy Equipment Purchase"
NEE_firepower_purchase_desc:0 "We will purchase tanks, artillery, motorized vehicles, and other equipment such as bullets to make sure our men are never out of ammo. With this effort, we can win against our more numerous rivals, as we will have many bullets for every soldier they can throw our way. Every soldier shall shout "pass the ammunition!" and we will fire until the enemy is eviscerated."

NEE_green_policy:0 "Green Policy"
NEE_green_policy_desc:0 "Theodore F. Green may not be a general, but he is one of our foremost politicians. A committed internationalist, he wishes to see New England take its rightful place on the world stage. To do that, Green knows we need a large army, to compete with our rivals. He has pushed legislation ramping up conscription to begin this effort."
NEE_consistant_conscription:0 "Consistent Conscription"
NEE_consistant_conscription_desc:0 "Green's bill has passed, and we are now conscripting our young men to build a larger army than ever before. None of our rivals will outnumber us. With such a force, we can project power up and down the East Coast and perhaps across the Atlantic, should we decide to help the Entente retake Europe."
NEE_moral_idealism:0 "Moral Idealism"
NEE_moral_idealism_desc:0 "We will fight the good fight, the right fight. The values of America that were once so important to her citizens are still important to us, and we will carry them with us everywhere we go. Let us show Canada our commitment to the fight against Syndicalism. Our commitment to international institutions has never been stronger!"
NEE_yankee_nationalism:0 "Yankee Patriotism"
NEE_yankee_nationalism_desc:0 "We are Yankees, and we are proud of it. Reactionaries to the south use this term in a derogatory meaning, but to New Englanders, it is part of our identity. Though we now fight with our old rulers, we will never forget we became in the meantime."
NEE_farmer_soldiers:0 "Farmers into Soldiers"
NEE_farmer_soldiers_desc:0 "Farmers should not be exempt from the draft. They are some of our strongest citizens, and could serve us well in the military. Besides, we could use all the men we can get, or so Green says. This will certainly provide us with more manpower, but it may have negative effects on our population's ability to eat."
NEE_silver_military_lease:0 "Silver Lease"
NEE_silver_military_lease_desc:0 "Let us release silver that the government owns, in order to help serve our war effort. Now that we have manpower in our military, Green wants us to also ramp up miiltary spending quite a bit, to pay for all the new equipment we will need. We have grudgingly done this, with the understanding that all this money will be put to good use."
NEE_mass_spending:0 "Mass Spending"
NEE_mass_spending_desc:0 "Green has seen our willingness to give him increased military spending, and he has run with it. He now makes impassioned speeches calling for a great increase in military spending, so that we can have the largest military in all of North America. While his goal may be outlandish for now, we cannot deny that he has a sort of point. Let us increase the spending once again."

### Setting up New England ###

newengland.1.t:0 "The Occupation of New England"
newengland.1.d:0 "The outbreak of civil war in America has left the New England region only lightly-defended and vulnerable to occupation. If we strike quickly and seize the region, we could close a weak point on our eastern flank and strengthen our position against any invasion from a hostile southern power. All but abandoned by their government, we anticipate our New England cousins will welcome our intervention."
newengland.1.a:0 "Seize New England!"
newengland.1.b:0 "It is too risky"

newengland.2.t:0 "Canada Moves Into New England"
newengland.2.d:0 "The New England region has been beset by syndicalist militia violence, to the point that the governors in the region - worried at the prospect of being overrun by [CSA.GetNameDef] and unwilling to wait for the Federal government to restore order - have requested that [CAN.GetNameDef] intervene with its forces to restore order. The Canadian government has sent us notification of their intent, and has stressed that they only wish to safeguard the lives of innocents and that they will discuss the matter further with the American government once peace has been restored. While some in the [Root.GetAdjective] cabinet feel the Canadians have violated our sovereignty, there is little we can do about it at the moment."
newengland.2.d.nocsa:0 "The New England region has been beset by syndicalist militia violence, to the point that the governors in the region - unwilling to wait for the Federal government to restore order - have requested that [CAN.GetNameDef] intervene with its forces to restore order. The Canadian government has sent us notification of their intent, and has stressed that they only wish to safeguard the lives of innocents and that they will discuss the matter further with the American government once peace has been restored. While some in the [Root.GetAdjective] cabinet feel the Canadians have violated our sovereignty, particularly since the SPA has not risen up as many feared, there is little we can do about it at the moment."
newengland.2.a:0 "To War"
newengland.2.b:0 "We will Deal with this later!"

newengland.3.t:0 "Terror in New England"
newengland.3.d:0 "New England has been besieged by syndicalist militia violence, and the governors in the region are terrified that the Federal government won't be able to prevent a rapid takeover of the entire region. Apparently they went so far as to formally request an intervention by [CAN.GetNameDef], but the Canadian government has declined to get involved... at least as of yet. As a result, militia groups in Boston are rapidly mobilizing to try and organize a proper defence of the area."
newengland.3.a:0 "We'll help as much as we're able"

newengland.5.t:0 "The Question of New England"
newengland.5.d:0 "Now that we have intervened in New England, a number of Canadian ministers have met with leaders from those states regarding how best to keep order. The states have suggested setting up a provisional government for the region, one that would - at least initially - be under our control and brought into the Entente alliance. Some members of the government, however, have suggested it would be better if we simply occupied and adminstered the territory ourselves. Americans, they say, can sometimes be of suspect loyalty - grateful or not, their goals may not mirror our own."
newengland.5.a:0 "Set up the provisional government"
newengland.5.b:0 "Set up the provisional government (play as New England)"
newengland.5.c:0 "Continue with the military occupation"

newengland.6.t:0 "The Provisional government of New England"
newengland.6.d:0 "Thanks to our allies in Canada, we have set up a provisional government in Boston as we prepare to liberate the rest of our country. Unfortunately, not many people both in and out of the states in New England believe that we are the true and legitimate America, and we must rectify this problem"
newengland.6.a:0 "Don't tread on me!"

newengland.7.t:0 "America is Reunited"
newengland.7.d:0 "At long last America has been reunited. We stretch once again from sea to shining sea. The traitors to the country have been destroyed and the stars and stripes now fly proudly from coast to coast knowing that liberty is secured for all."
newengland.7.a:0 "At long last"

## Focus Tree Events ###

newengland.10.t:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
newengland.10.d:0 "A bill has come before to help improve the conditions of the workers within America. This bill is facing some push-back from the more conservative members of Congress that believe that we are trying to implement syndicalism. So, the question is will congress pass the bill or not."
newengland.10.a:0 "Pass the Act."
newengland.10.b:0 "Do Not Pass the Act."

newengland.11.t:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
newengland.11.d:0 "A bill has come before to help improve the conditions of the economy and workplace. The so-called Labor-Relations Act is obviously designed to help the businesses over the workers. And thus, it is facing push-back from the more liberal members of Congress that believe it does not go far enough. So, the question is will congress pass the bill or not."
newengland.11.a:0 "Pass the Act."
newengland.11.b:0 "Do not Pass the Act."

newengland.12.t:0 "New England Demands Home Rule"
newengland.12.d:0 "The New England provisional government, now that it has established its military and structure, has demanded that it be granted home rule. Some members of the Canadian government are taken aback by the tone of the demand, seeing as the Canadian government is what enabled New Englanders to avoid the chaos rampant in the rest of America, though others (perhaps rightly) point out that unless Canada's ambition is to govern Americans as colonial subjects there is no reason not to give New England what it seeks."
newengland.12.a:0 "Grant them home rule."
newengland.12.b:0 "No, they are too valuable."

newengland.13.t:0 "Canada Agrees"
newengland.13.d:0 "The Canadian government has responded to our demand in the affirmative. They are ready to relinquish all control over our government apparatus, and have expressed williness to work with us as equal partners in the Entente alliance."
newengland.13.a:0 "We are grateful."

newengland.14.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
newengland.14.d:0 "Perhaps deciding that we are too valuable an asset in their quest to retake the Home Isles, or perhaps secretly coveting New England's territory as their own, the Canadian government has refused to grant New England home rule. We are, at least for the foreseeable future, their subject...something which has provided a serious blow to our government's legitimacy."
newengland.14.a:0 "This is an outrage!"

newengland.15.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declares Independence"
newengland.15.d:0 "Chafing ever since we refused them home rule, the New England government has finally declared its independence, abandoning our alliance entirely."
newengland.15.a:0 "So be it."
newengland.15.b:0 "No, this cannot be allowed!"

newengland.124.t:0 "New England's Foreign Policy?"
newengland.124.d:0 "Our young nation must now create a foreign policy for itself. Two main schools of thought have presented themselves. One says we move closer to our allies in the North, and help the Entente. The other promotes a more neutral approach to foreign policy that will see us govern ourselves."`
newengland.124.a:0 "Cooperate with the Entente"
newengland.124.b:0 "Go our own way"

newengland.20.d:0 "Following the chaos of the Canadian Intervention, the governors of the New England states met together to select an interim president.

newengland.40.t:0 "The Great New England Hurricane of 1938"
newengland.40.d:0 "What was first considered a non-issue, the Yankee Clipper Hurricane arrived on Long Island September 21st and would only a few hours later turn out to be largest Hurricane to set foot in New England since the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.\n\nMoving North from Long Island to Connecticut, Rhode Island and up through Vermont the storm cost the lives of close to 700 people. By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."
newengland.40.a:0 "God save us all."

newengland.41.t:0 "Road integration with Canada?"
newengland.41.d:0 "As we continue building up our economy and expanding the road network, the question arose of which direction we should drive on. While the custom in America has always been to drive on the right Canada has, since the British revolution in 1925, driven on the left.\n\nSome political leaders have suggested that we switch to driving on the Left in an attempt to better integrate our road network into the Canadian one whilst others of course wish to stay driving on the right to further amplify that New England is not a British Dominion."
newengland.41.a:0 "We shall adapt to the British model."
newengland.41.b:0 "American cars drive on the side of Freedom!"

### Underground Railroad ###
newengland.50.t:0 "The Underground Railroad"
newengland.50.d:0 "Established in the 1700s, the first Underground Railroad served as a network of secret routes with as purpose to clandestinely transport Afro-American slaves from the Thirteen Colonies into Canada where slavery was already abolished.\n\nWith the American Civil War tearing apart households across the Americans and ideological strive leading to the forced expulsion or sometimes even massacre of Americans, our government has reignited the old "Railroad" and has with the aid of locals on both sides of the border re-established the network with the hopes of safely transporting refugees to our little nation."
newengland.50.a:0 "There is only so much we can do though..."

#CSA
newengland.51.t:0 "The Lake Erie Migration Crisis"
newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as opposing forces fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."
newengland.51.a:0 "Allow covert operatives to establish a base on Pelee Island."
newengland.51.b:0 "We can not put the lives of innocents in danger with our schemes!"

newengland.52.t:0 "Successful Smuggling Operation on Lake Erie"
newengland.52.d:0 "Tucked away beneath sheets of linen and between the clothes of refugees, our covert operatives on the far side of Lake Erie have been able to successfully smuggle small arms, munition, medical supplies. Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the carcass"

newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers apprehended!"
newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carabines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."
newengland.53.a:0 "Change the course of the routes, we can not stop the operation!"
newengland.53.b:0 "It's too risky, we should focus on the refugee program."

newengland.54.t:0 ""Jack" the Doberman"
newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop militia agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the agents who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."
newengland.54.a:0 "We express our thanks to this good boy!"

newengland.55.t:0 "Refugees from the CSA"
newengland.55.d:0 "The horrors of war keep raging in [CSA.GetNameDef] and the large migratory wave from theirs into our territory seems to know no end. Just as last month, the Underground Railroad has once again led to the successful transfer of thousands of these war refugees into our Safe Harbour."
newengland.55.a:0 "Let us pray the violence will end soon."

#TEX
newengland.56.t:0 "Refugees from the AUS"
newengland.56.d:0 "Although the journey is full of peril and even though bandits and/or criminals stalk the trails from the deep South all the way to Connecticut, thousands still depart on the journey hoping that they may find peace and a protector in our nation."
newengland.56.a:0 "Welcome to New England!"

newengland.57.t:0 "Pelley asserts control in the AUS"
newengland.57.d:0 "It came as no surprise to the people of America that Huey Long served only as a tool for the far more dangerous Pelley. Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."
newengland.57.a:0 "We have no place for them either!"
newengland.57.b:0 "Install strict refugee quotas and only allow a select few in."
newengland.57.c:0 "In Boston one is not discriminated for the colour of his skin!"

newengland.58.t:0 "Unchecked Migration"
newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organizations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organizations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realizing that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."
newengland.58.a:0 "Close the Border!"
newengland.58.b:0 "We are the only hope these people have, let them in!"

newengland.59.t:0 "Appointing the New England Poet laureate"
newengland.59.d:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The top candidate in the congressional poll is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. Public polls, however, has shown favour for the pulp fiction writer H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft has written in the papers that he would accept this award, but not appear in public for the ceremony. The Library of Congress is in a bind."
newengland.59.a:0 "Robert Frost, Modernist Master."
newengland.59.b:0 "H.P Lovecraft, the master of horror."

newengland.60.t:0 "Intervention for John Winant"
newengland.60.d:0 "The private life of President Winant is not the proper subject of newspaper gossip, but after today, it is a public issue. President Winant's minders found a loaded gun in his bedroom tonight, and after a panic determined their was no intended assassin. President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter. Fortunately, Winston Churchill was very gently notified, and forgave President Winant in person. Winant has decided to take a few days break to recuperate mentally."
newengland.60.a:0 "He just need a few days off."

newengland.61.t:0 "Gerry Campaigns for Mackenzie King"
newengland.61.d:0 "Long before his career in politics, Peter Gerry was a student at Harvard. There, he was tutored by Canadian Deputy Minister of Labor William Lyon King. These lessons had a major impact on Gerry. Now, King is a major Liberal politician whose allies stateside are the Republicans and the Liberals. As a President, Gerry has talked with his advisers about crossing the party line to help his old mentor. This would invariably debase the Democrats, and aid the Liberals in America. "
newengland.61.a:0 "Don't cross party lines!"
newengland.61.b:0 "Gerry can campaign as he pleases."

newengland.62.t:0 "Cocoanut Grove fire traced back to Tobin"
newengland.62.d:0 "A massive fire erupted in the popular Boston nightclub, Cocoanut Grove, leaving almost 500 people dead. Among the victims are several high ranking American immigrants, and the uproar searching for an answer has raced the highest halls of power. It appears that several mid-level Democratic party politicians had taken bribes earlier this month before an inspection. This inspection was independently determined to be insufficient, and the public prosecutor is preparing a case aledging massive conspiracy. This has rocked public support for Democrats across New England."
newengland.62.a:0 "A shame upon the city."

newengland.63.t:0 "Rockefeller Center artifacts recovered, some defaced"
newengland.63.d:0 "Since the abandoning of New York City to the militant unions, Nelson has sought to recover whatever he can from his prized Rockefeller Center. It appears now, that most of the artwork installed in the skyscraper is now for sale, which Nelson took advantage of. When these relics of a peaceful America arrived, we were all ashamed to find them defaced. It appears Diego Rivera, whose murals were rejected for installation, took it upon himself to replace images of Zeus with Marx. Among several other mythological heroes were all strategically replaced with their respective socialist myth-men. These priceless works of art are ruined."
newengland.63.a:0 "I'll get you Rivera, someday!"

newengland.64.t:0 "Canadians apply for West Point"
newengland.64.d:0 "The Class of 1944 has just arrived, and their numbers are far below expectations. As it is still necessary for Senators to recommend prospective young men, the decrease from 100 new cadets to just 14. It has been suggested that we allow Canadian politicians to recommend their young men to West Point. We are in dire need of new officers, and yet at the same time, this time honored tradition ensures that this institution isn't used by foreign powers, much less the Crown."
newengland.64.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
newengland.64.b:0 "We do need the people."

### Freedom Fliers ###
newengland.70.t:0 "Choosing our Propaganda"
newengland.70.d:0 "The "Freedom Fliers" initiative has been activated by our government but there is still much discussion about the content of the dropped messages as the right message could wreak havoc behind their lines but the wrong message could further bolster their resolve.\n\nWhether to strike the civilian population or the armed forces directly also remains a topic for debate as some have argued that the enemy homefront would be more susceptible to our message but a direct strike on their armed forces could lead to a more direct effect."
newengland.70.a:0 "Attempt to disrupt their attack plans with wrong information."
newengland.70.b:0 "Trick their troops in leaving gaps in their defences."
newengland.70.c:0 "Spread uncertainty on their Home Front."
newengland.70.e:0 "Try to demoralise their troops."

newengland.71.t:0 "The Tale of Private Bob 'Daredevil' Rogers"
newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above enemy territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by an anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering enemy supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathizers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob traveled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the enemy agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."
newengland.71.a:0 "The American nation thanks her son for his service!"

newengland.72.t:0 "Further Expansion of the 'Freedom Fliers'"
newengland.72.d:0 "Recent successes with the Corps have prompted many to question whether the planes should also be used to perform air drops behind enemy lines to supply the resistance cells with weapons and further equipment. Some have argued however that this deviates too far from the original peaceful mission of the Freedom Fliers and that the extra equipment and manpower necessary for the operations might very well be better spend elsewhere."
newengland.72.a:0 "Assign them the resources!"
newengland.72.b:0 "It's too risky."

newengland.73.t:0 "Sabotage on the Bedford Army Air Field"
newengland.73.d:0 "Under cover of darkness and with support from within, foreign operatives have succeeded in causing massive damage to the fighter planes stationed in Bedford. Dozens of planes have been lost or damaged and the hangars have suffered from various small explosions. We have thus far been unable to stop them and there isn't even an answer as to which faction the saboteurs adhere."
newengland.73.a:0 "Are we blind? Deploy the Garrison!"

newengland.80.t:0 "The Yankee Rebellion"
newengland.80.d:0 "While our intention upon occupying New England was to safeguard the locals from the ravages of the American Civil War, it seems many of them have taken exception. Several leaders in Boston have publicly accused Canada of desiring solely to return the area to British rule, to squeeze whatever we can out of the region so that we can return to the Home Isles, and that they would have been better off throwing their lot in with their American brothers and sisters. The fever pitch in the area has reached the point where we may have to reconsider our plan for New England self-government... or face a long period of uprisings."
newengland.80.a:0 "This will amount to nothing."
newengland.80.b:0 "Bah, very well - set up the provisional government."

newengland.85.t:0 "Yankee Rebellion Over"
newengland.85.d:0 "It has taken many months, but it appears the so-called Yankee Rebellion in New England is over. Resistance leaders have either been captured or fled, and the remaining local governments all seem to be on board with the Canadian government - spurred on, one imagines, by the pictures of devastation throughout the rest of America playing across their newspaper pages. We should see no further trouble in the area."
newengland.85.a:0 "Finally!"

newengland.90.t:0 "Rejoining America"
newengland.90.d.forced:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs. There was little time to discuss the matter in Boston, however, as almost instantly a public campaign swept across the country demanding we dissolve the government at once. New England, the public feels, is not a real country - and its government does not have sufficient legitimacy to refuse the [From.GetAdjective] request."
newengland.90.d.choice:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs, now that the civil war is over and the victor decided. There are many who feel that the main purpose of New England's provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - has been served, and we should become part of America once again. There are others, however, who feel that New England has achieved its own sense of legitimacy. We have a place in the British sphere, and is being a part of [From.GetNameDef] what we truly want? Are they truly the America we remember?"
newengland.90.a:0 "It seems we have no choice but to agree..."
newengland.90.b:0 "We should rejoin America."
newengland.90.c:0 "No, this is not in our best interests."

newengland.91.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Request"
newengland.91.d:0 "The ambassador from [From.GetNameDef] has met with [Root.GetAdjective] officials and presented their plan: they wish to peacefully reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], effective immediately. Now that the civil war is done, they believe the purpose of New England's provisional government - namely to avoid the chaos and destruction - is also passed. America, they say, must be one once more. There is a mixed reaction within the government, though most agree that [requester.GetNameDef] will not sit idly by should we refuse."
newengland.91.a:0 "Then we wish them well."
newengland.91.b:0 "We agree, if [requester.GetNameDef] joins the Entente."
newengland.91.c:0 "No, we cannot permit that."

newengland.92.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.92.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed that the provisional government's purpose is done. They hold no claim over the New England region and wish no conflict with [requester.GetNameDef], nor intend to make any demands upon them for New England's return. [From.GetAdjective] forces have begun to leave the area immediately."
newengland.92.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

newengland.93.t:0 "Reunion with New England"
newengland.93.d:0 "Officials from New England delivered the message promptly: they will gladly unite with [Root.GetNameDef] at once. The purpose of their provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - is now over with, and they look forward to America being whole once again."
newengland.93.a:0 "Excellent!"

newengland.94.t:0 "The Canadian Concern"
newengland.94.d:0 "While the New England government is not a Canadian puppet, it would be false to suggest that it wasn't part of the British Empire - such as it is - and of great concern to the larger Canadian sphere of interest. The Canadian government is willing to allow New England to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], since the reason for Canada's intervention in the region ended with the civil war, but they are asking that [requester.GetNameDef] join the Entente alliance. This would make up for New England's loss, and also be a way to pay back [CAN.GetNameDef] for saving American lives."
newengland.94.a:0 "We'll see where this goes..."
newengland.94.b:0 "We're fine with that request."
newengland.94.c:0 "No, they have no right to make that demand."

newengland.95.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.95.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned with agreement - they will join the Entente in exchange for a peaceful reunion with New England, and as a way to pay back [Root.GetNameDef] for safeguarding so many American lives during the civil war."
newengland.95.a:0 "Might amenable of them!"

newengland.96.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.96.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned to Canada with a flat refusal - they will not bargain for New England's return, particularly since [CAN.GetNameDef] had no right to intervene in the civil war in the first place. The officials say that Canada took control of New England to safeguard themselves against radical forces, nothing more. With that threat gone, America should once again be whole."
newengland.96.a:0 "I wish mommy and daddy would stop fighting..."
newengland.96.b:0 "Very well, let them go."
newengland.96.c:0 "Then we refuse."

newengland.97.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.97.d.forced:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham. Since the New England lacks sufficient legitimacy to act as anything but a Canadian puppet, it has dissolved in a spasm of in-fighting and fury against the Canadians."
newengland.97.d.choice:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham: they intervened to safeguard British interests, nothing more. Now the New England government must decide for itself where its interests lie, and perhaps spark a war either way."
newengland.97.a:0 "So be it!"
newengland.97.b:0 "We will join [requester.GetNameDef] anyhow!"
newengland.97.c:0 "We remain with [From.GetNameDef]"

newengland.98.t:0 "New England Dissolves"
newengland.98.d:0 "With our refusal to allow New England to rejoin [requester.GetNameDef], their government has utterly dissolved due to internal conflict and a sense of it having no true legitimacy. The region is once again under our control, and very possibly may lead us into a war with [requester.GetNameDef]."
newengland.98.a:0 "So be it!"

newengland.99.t:0 "[war_country.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.99.d.exists:0 "For reasons not well understood, the New England government has decided that its best interests are served remaining a part of the British sphere. Many within our government are enraged, and wonder if New England's citizens feel the same as its government... or, perhaps it is better to say, the British?"
newengland.99.d.notexists:0 "While it appears New Englanders were more than willing to join with us peacefully, the Canadian intervention has exposed their provisional government for what it was: a puppet, subject to the will of the British crown. With their refusal to allow New England to choose its own destiny, the New England government has collapsed and been re-absorbed into [CAN.GetNameDef]."
newengland.99.a:0 "Then it's war!"
newengland.99.b:0 "We'll deal with this later."

newengland.100.t:0 "New England's Betrayal"
newengland.100.d:0 "While our government had refused New England's right to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], it seems they eventually decided to do so anyhow. Our forces in the region have pulled out as American forces moved in, and there appears to be nothing we can do - unless we choose to force the issue and make this a matter of war."
newengland.100.a:0 "Then it's war!"
newengland.100.b:0 "Let them have it."

#HoTB#

newengland.101.t:0 "Syndicalist Revolts Increase!"
newengland.101.d:0 "While with Canadian backing we have managed to re-establish some order in the region syndicalist strikers are nonetheless extremely active in Massachusetts and militants are receiving support from the Combined Syndicates of America, with Leonard Abbott apparently organizing revolts against us from New York City, with rumors he plans to call on the workers to rise up at once and join the CSA. With the IWW and Socialist Parties still causing problems it is clear we are not out of the woods yet, and governor [NEE.GetLeader] has declared that anyone who attempts to overthrow the government and establish a 'syndicalist tyranny' will face the full force of the law."
newengland.101.a:0 "We will be ready"

newengland.102.t:0 "Radical Coalition formalizes!"
newengland.102.d:0 "The so-called Radical Coalition has cemented its political alliance in reaction to both Canadian and syndicalist influence in New England. This occurred after members of the two leading factions of the movement, "The Remnant" and "The Sentinels of the Republic", met and agreed to pool together their formally fairly weak militias. A loose grouping within New England lead by right-wing intellectuals and organizations, the Coalition is unified in viewing the State as the ultimate threat to man and the syndicalists as merely another group of fanatics attempting to use it for their own agenda of abolishing property laws. With the increase in populist movements in recent years, more middle and upper class citizens have listened to this faction of New England politics as both a counter-revolutionary force and a solution to the problem of politics. Albert Jay Nock is leader of the Remnant and the Freemen magazine, and the more radical wing of the Coalition, the Sentinels of the Republic, started as a right-wing lobbying group fighting virtually all forms of government intervention in the economy before going through a series of internal radicalizations. This involved influence from the Remnant and New England Right before turning to a mixture of Social Darwinist sciences and reinterpretations of Egoism to use their arguments against not only wealth redistribution but any attacks on the wealthy. This is something the original Egoists, whose arguments they borrowed, have mixed or even negative feelings about. \n\n With the formalization of the alliance, their supporters in Congress have officially changed their party affiliation to the Radical Coalition, with the Sentinels providing the funding and the Remnant the militia volunteers. Together they declare man's freedoms will not end so long as they are on watch."
newengland.102.a:0 "Extremists!"

newengland.103.t:0 "The Great Strike!"
newengland.103.d:0 "Using the semi-legal SPA's machine, Abbott has directed the New England workers to choose today to do a mass strike and have the militias rise at the same time, calling it the "two-pronged strategy"! Red Guards are overtaking South Boston and have some of our dockyards are suffering from mass strikes. We will need to act at once! We must either send our own men to try to overtake the militias which will be bloody but likely end in a victory, request Canadian assistance at the cost of likely becoming more reliant on Canada, something that is sure to anger many New Englanders but might end in a more favorable resolution. However some of our advisors believe to give Canada an opening to occupy our soil would open the gates to other extremist movements and believe we should just stomp it out ourselves."
newengland.103.a:0 "We can handle this!"
newengland.103.b:0 "Request Canada's aid!"

#Federalist Party Path#

newengland.104.t:0 "Canada crushes the rebellion!"
newengland.104.d:0 "Canadian Troops have stormed South Boston and swiftly ended the rebellion, leaving over 50 dead and the city pacified. The dockyard strikers chose to give up shortly afterwards and go home after a warning was issued by the commanding officers that they had an hour to end their strike. With Canada now enforcing martial law over Boston and our port towns we are pratically left even more completely at their mercy and already they are requesting help from members of the 'Loyalist' Federalist Party in maintaining control."
newengland.104.a:0 "A phyric victory perhaps"

newengland.105.t:0 "Control of New England"
newengland.105.d:0 "New England has come under our direct control! After they requested the Canadian military intervene in a syndicalist strike the commanding officers in charge of protecting New England wasted no time in putting down the strikers but now they are left with control of Boston and several port cities, giving us control over their industrial economy. The Federalist Party of New England contains our most hardline supporters and as they are providing our officers with support the are requesting (alongside our political advisors and our military) we place them in charge to ensure a more stable New England and see that our losses were not for nothing."
newengland.105.a:0 "Appoint them"
newengland.105.b:0 "No, we should not intervene too heavily"

newengland.106.t:0 "The Federalist Party appointed!"
newengland.106.d:0 "Canada has requested we begin to step down and allow the Federalist Party to take charge, offering us political security and funding in return for accepting the offer. It is clear they are not asking however and as we have virtually no means to oppose them as we gifted them much of our military and economic might. With the Vanderbilt and Astor families already competing for power within the Federalist machine to prepare for Canadian appointments, Radicals are already furious at the idea of English royalists seizing the nation and have stated their intent to declare a revolution, but do not have quite enough resources to do so. Perhaps it would be better to endorse the Radical cause and provide it with our remaining military and political aid to pressure Canada to leave, effectively allowing us to play both sides, although many would see this as a dangerous ploy when Canada offers us security."
newengland.106.a:0 "Allow the Federalists to take charge"
newengland.106.b:0 "Request aid from the Radicals!"

newengland.107.t:0 "Choosing a Proper President"
newengland.107.d:0 "The Federalist Party of New England is, in collaboration with th Canadian and New England political elite, taking control of New England as they are placed in increasingly powerful cabinet positions, SPA and Radical members of congress are removed to be replaced with the Loyalists and they are gifted manpower and economic contracts from the Crown. However the situation is still unstable and they have yet to even unify behind a candidate for President, of which the well-connected and pro-Federalist Astor and Vanderbilt families seemingly spending every dime and bit of political capital competing for top spot. The Astor's closer ties to Canada's political elite give them greater comfort to the Canadian elite and more direct political ties whereas the Vanderbilt's are favored by more of New England for their wealth being based out of the region and heavier philanthropy, with their new money extravagances often being the talk of the town (for better or worse). /n/The candidates include the more traditionally aristocrat and English officer John Jacob Astor whose birth in America would technically make him qualified to run for President but nonetheless makes him more unpopular to locals, the philanthropist Vincent Astor who is more popular within New England (by Astor standards) but less connected to us and too personally reformist for the tastes of many Canadian conservatives, prominent yachtsman and card player Harold Stirling Vanderbilt who seems acceptable to the New England populace despite being less so to Canadian royals and finally motor car racer William Kissam Vanderbilt, whom is quite popular in the area but only somewhat interesting in governing if not for his family allowing him to use him as a candidate."

newengland.1070.d:0 "A day after the Federalist-pluralist House quickly elected [NEE.GetLeader] as President as the centrist parties watched on, he was swore in as President of New England in a ceremony that included the Prime Minister of Canada, members of the royal family, New Hampshire Federalist Governor Styles Bridges, James Michael Curley, and various members of wealthy New England families. The whole affair has not gone on without controversy as figures as diverse as Hamilton Fish III and George Aiken denounced the ceremony as a sham being used by Canada to push their own agenda onto New England."
newengland.1070.a:0 "Well it will have to do"

newengland.108.t:0 "Investigate sailors?"
newengland.108.d:0 "As we crackdown on the presence of syndicalist traitors within New England there are reports of syndicalist aligned workers among the port unions. Currently the SPA radicals are already so neutered that these union workers likely pose no threat but Canada is pushing us to either investigate or outlaw unions among ports associated with the syndicalist strikers, and law and order figures are pressuring us to listen to them. Perhaps it's best to be better safe than sorry."
newengland.108.a:0 "Leave it alone"
newengland.108.b:0 "Investigate the unions"
newengland.108.c:0 "Shit down questionable unions"

newengland.109.t:0 "The SPA Old Guard"
newengland.109.d:0 "While the remaining Red Guard militants and syndicalist radicals are being hunted down there remains the question of what to do with the New England 'Old Guard' of the SPA. A more reformist section of the SPA, whom while clearly biased towards the CSA towards opposing a revolution within New England and are ambivalent about the CSA's actual methods. Their relatively moderate stance has gained them political seats in local, state and even a handful of national representative positions. Removing them may be more difficult to justify but as they give cover to the Red Guards and would collaborate with the CSA and their allies in a heart beat it would grant us much safety to do so and it is clearly what Canada favors."
newengland.109.a:0 "Just monitor them"
newengland.109.b:0 "Arrest them"

newengland.110.t:0 "A New Capital?"
newengland.110.d:0 "The news is in a fervor as King [CAN.GetLeader] has made a visit to roaring crowds to promote the "Special Relationship" between Canada and New England as a part of the Federalist-Canadian co-effort to promote relations. Recently our advisors have heard from the Great North that Canadian advisors to the King have heard a rumor we might move the Capital to Concord to have a closer proximity to Canada in a show of goodwill. While it's unknown which Federalists promoted this rumor, we do now that doing so during the King's visit would without a doubt promote positive relations, perhaps gaining us more political support from Canada."
newengland.110.a:0 "Concord is now the Capital"
newengland.110.b:0 "Keep the current capital"

newengland.111.t:0 "Ship Contracts"
newengland.111.d:0 "Using our contacts in the British aristocracy we were able to get ahold of an offer from the Montreal based Canada Steamship Lines which is being pressured by the English government to offer us ships at a discount price. However some in both our government and Canada would rather go a step farther and purchase failing local ports and sell them to the CSL in return for discount prices on future ships. This would incur anger among locals however and be far more costly than simply buring the convoys however."

newengland.111.b:0 "Help the CLS"

newengland.112.t:0 "The Hamiltonian Debate"
newengland.112.d:0 "The Hamiltonian Constitution caused outrage the second it was introduced by the party. The few remaining politicians affiliated with the Radical Coalition are decrying it as a betrayal of the Constitution, something backed by various Republicans, Progressives and Democrats such as Al Smith. However with the Federalist Party controlling congress, Federalist Party congressmen Samuel Dickstein and William I. Sirovich gave speeches decrying dissenters for opposing a reform that is not only truer to New England's heritage but will ensure safety. Nonetheless the most controversial parts of the new Constitution, including a provision that would see the both the President and Senators elected for life by electors is sure to endanger only more hatred until it can pass, as would its weakening of the states for Federal power. However, with Canada's backing and the military on our side there is little they can do."
newengland.112.a:0 "Fools"

newengland.113.t:0 "Radicals attack!"
newengland.113.d:0 "The Radical Militants have attacked troops guarding a Canadian diplomat Herbert Meredith Marler, firing rifles at him as he existed his hotel from behind shop windows across the street. Marler was saved by the troops intervention but three soldiers and two radicals died. The Radical papers have either claimed we are responsible for the attacking for 'attacking American freedom repeatedly' or outright endorsed it while the remaining Radicals in Congress not arrested during the Federalist takeover are warning us to stand down. At least they have finally given us an excuse to end them and push through the new Constitution after we have unseat them."
newengland.113.a:0 "Crackdown now"

newengland.114.t:0 "Sentinel Offer"
newengland.114.d:0 "As the Remnant falls back their leader Albert Jay Nock has fled for South America while Robert R. McCormick and his inner circle have reportedly taken a ship to Denmark. Interestingly while the Remnant militias continue to fight us the Sentinels of the Republic have come to us with an offer, claiming they will accept the Federalist Party if the DuPont family and other Sentinel associates are allowed to continue their business in the region. Of course, hardline Egoists and 'Radical Anarchists' in the party are unlikely to go with it, but with the wealthy upper core of the Sentinels on our side we would have their wealth resources at our disposal. However, some in Canada and at home such as Federalsit Party whip Samuel Dickstein would prefer to finish the job, believing we could replace the Sentinels with Federalist and Canadian businesses and finish off potential traitors, although it would be an initially costly fight to takeover the DuPonts."
newengland.114.a:0 "Cut the Deal"
newengland.114.b:0 "Finish them"

newengland.115.t:0 "Re-legalize Absinthe?"
newengland.115.d:0 "A popular but highly potent liquor Absinthe, also called "The Green Fairy", was a popular drink in England before the revolution and remains so in Canada among those who can afford access to either local production or imports from Portugal. Our recent collaboration with the liquor business has caused requests from Entente elites asking for a government approved corporation to purchase and distribute it, which they argue would benefit both sides. While the United States banned it under the Wilson administration under the belief it caused hallucinations in its users we could easily reverse this and approve the trade deal they are requesting."
newengland.115.a:0 "A No-Brainer"
newengland.115.b:0 "We Shouldn't"

newengland.116.t:0 "Hamiltonian Constitution Ratified"
newengland.116.d:0 "The Hamiltonian Constitution has officially been ratified and with it President [NEE.GetLeader]'s executive powers have been expanded, state powers are weakened and the President now serves for life. The Radicals appear to have finally been defeated and with it our main opposition is gone. Federalist Party members such as Styles Bridges has moved to have those Congressmen and governors who did not outright side with the Federalists during the Radical attacks to be removed from office just as the Radicals were and replaced with Federalists until they come up for re-election, although our advisors would prefer if we simply removed them and had new snap elections on the spot for the seats."

newengland.1160.t:0 "A new Astor considered"
newengland.1160.d:0 "Given the President's long presence some are considering if it would be better for him to step down since having the first President serve for life might be a bit too much for many Americans, with some newspaper critics becoming increasingly brave and critical. John Jacob Astor, who is already famous for being a Titanic survivor as a baby, has been using his connections in a bid to 'run' for President, arguing it would be smoother considering the current president has already served longer than what Americans are used to and that it would ease pressure from 'democracy' advocates. Ultimately it comes down us, but if we refuse we will have to do another round of repression of critics, including shutting down hostile newspapers."
newengland.1160.a:0 "I will not step down"
newengland.1160.b:0 "Usher in John Jacob Astor"

#Radical Path#
newengland.117.t:0 "Radicals Push Back!"
newengland.117.d:0 "The Radicals are furious at the attempts of the Federalist Party to take power after their leaders were alerted to their attempts. With the support of our officially rogue state guard they are securing the roads between Boston and Canada to prevent their forces from being resupplied and the pro-Federalist Styles Bridges has been kkept captive in his own home by Sentinel forces before he could aid them. Without a way of maintaining New England without a full war, the Federalist and Canadian forces have agreed to return home."
newengland.117.a:0 "Great!"

newengland.118.t:0 "Radicals Take Congress!"
newengland.118.d:0 "With their forces spread throughout New England and continued rallying of citizens to their cause to maintain sovereignty, the Radicals have demanded control of Congress, removing politicians who were found to be too friendly to the Federalist, Canadian or Socialist cause and replacing them with their own, and the Congress moved to continue to support this on a state level. As such, the Radicals have control of our Congress to the enthusiasm of popular writers such as H.L. Mencken and horror to Canadian allies. It appears their American revolutionary uniforms have become less goofy than we once we dismissed them as."
newengland.118.a:0 "Out of the Frying Pot..."

newengland.119.t:0 "Radical Constitutional Congress!"
newengland.119.d:0 "The Radicals have moved to hold a constitutional convention with delegates appointed by each state in New England, modeled on the original constitution. Of course, as the Radicals now control most state legislatures after forcing out "Canadian and Socialist collaborators", this effectively means they will have a large majority of the delegates, with some approved Democrats and Republicans attending, and a small percent of progressives."
newengland.119.a:0 "We are in their hands now"

newengland.120.t:0 "Radical Split!"
newengland.120.d:0 "Since the beginning of the Constitutional Coalition there has been frictures between the Radicals, namely the Remnant and the Sentinels of the Republic. The Remnant favor a constitutional republic with a minimalist state, but is split on the question of whether or not democracy should be a component of it or if it's too dangerous to democracy. The Sentinels are far more radical, favoring the solution of the state in favor of a "Natural Capitalism", and are led by the DuPoint family, whom are being accused of literally buying delegates with Sentinel funds. In between them are the more traditional anarcho-egoists who are split between a Sentinel force they view as corrupting their message but nonetheless are more serious about dissolving the state and supporting the Remnant. It is likely they will decide the dominant faction."

newengland.120.b:0 "Remnant Leadership"

newengland.121.t:0 "Remnant Leader Election"
newengland.121.d:0 "With the Remnants in charge the delegates must agree on a leader of th state, who is now titled the President of the United States in Congress Assembled after the old Articles of Confederation title. It is between the more anti-democratic Albert Jay Nock and the more moderate Robert McCormick. As it is largely a symbolic title there is relatively little bad blood to snatch the position."
newengland.121.a:0 "Albert Jay Nock"
newengland.121.b:0 "Robert McCormick"

###Liberal Victory###
newengland.122.t:0 "Syndicalists felled"
newengland.122.d:0 "We have felled the syndicalists, with our armies taking Boston after a brief battle with the syndicalists in Boston. With our victory, liberalism is safe and Canadian influence has been kept away from New England and although it may take awhile the recover our losses the revolutionary left is finished in New England. With this victory elections will be held shortly."
newengland.122.a:0 "Great"

###Sentinels###
newengland.130.t: "Settling Business"
newengland.130.d:0 "With the spread and victory of the Sentinels, the du Pont and Pitcairn families and their allies who are the main movers of the organization on the largest level have taken an eye towards the businesses of the New England families whom aligned themselves with 'Federalism' in an attempt the dominate the economic sphere. With the tables turn, a debate has broken out within the organization, with the Pitcairn's wanting to demand a 'fee' from them for their disloyalty to liberty and the du Pont faction preferring to utilize our militias at once to push them out of the region and seize their territory and businesses to ensure they do not get a second chance to destroy us."
newengland.130.a:0 "Push them out"
newengland.130.b:0 "Demand a fee!"

newengland.131.t:0 "Worker's Strike!"
newengland.131.d:0 "Worker's in one of the du Pont's industrial chemistry factories have begun to strike following a string of deaths they blame on 'unsafe working conditions'. This is utterly unbelievable as they had freely sold their labor under contract and are now attempting to extort a business they could leave following the end of their contract or, following egoist thought, if they were strong enough to resist it. This socialism needs to be stomped out at once."
newengland.131.a:0 "Fire them all"
newengland.131.b:0 "Send the militia"

newengland.132.t:0 "Fate of Jewish Business"
newengland.132.d:0 "It is no secret that many in the Sentinels, especially du Pont and Alexander Lincoln hold strongly anti-Semitic views, associating Jews with socialist subversion, racial inferiority and hostility to Anglo-Saxons. However, not all Sentinels are eager to back these views, with some merely being practical businessmen who would rather cut a deal with Jewish-owned businesses and one of the more intellectual wings of the Sentinels, the Egoists, not being enthusiastic about such plans. As such while seizing these businesses would be welcome to the most militant Sentinels it would see some slight pushback."
newengland.132.a:0 "Force them out"
newengland.132.b:0 "Have them trade with us"

newengland.133.t:0 "Independence of Boston"
newengland.133.d:0 "While our combination of dissolving the state with the expansion of the Sentinels and its military has seen the end of many former political entities with the dominance of either towns, business, individuals or us, Boston remains an issue under James Michael Curley's political machine. Promising the population protection from instability the machine continues to exist with its own police force, promising a continuation of democracy on their own level. We could allow this but having one of the largest trade hubs under their control, even if they do not stand in our way and allow us to do business there, would be less than ideal."
newengland.133.a:0 "Dismantle the machine. By force."
newengland.133.b:0 "Allow it for loyalty"

newengland.134.t:0 "Battle with Vermont"
newengland.134.d:0 "The state of Vermont under the leadership of George Aiken has refused to dismantle its government and allow the Sentinel form of government to take charge. Without federal funding they are strapped for resources however, so we could simply push into their territory now, although it would cost us some men."
newengland.134.a:0 "Take the territory"
newengland.134.b:0 "Tolerate them"

newengland.135.t:0 "Survival of the Fittest"
newengland.135.d:0 "Among the top Sentinels most fervent beliefs is in Social Darwinism, believing that a philosophy of survival of the fittest creates a stronger people. However, some of the businesses we have been taking have been pushing back with firearms of their own, and to take the lands of homeowners and force them to pay rent to us would be even more difficult even if we have the largest show of force at the moment. As such, many would have us slow our expansionism to focus on consolidating our men while we deal with these men through contract instead of force."
newengland.135.a:0 "Use Contracts"
newengland.135.b:0 "No, keep expanding"

newengland.136.t:0 "Children attempt to escape!"
newengland.136.d:0 "A group of children attempted to escape from one of our orphanages in New Hampshire! Growing restless with their workweeks after signing contracts in return for food and board, they broke out late at night after stealing supplies and were recaptured the next day. Even with our dominance of the area many are sympathetic of these children, causing an appeal for them not to be penalized."
newengland.136.a:0 "Extend their contracts"
newengland.136.b:0 "A single allowance"

###Radicals###
newengland.140.t:0 "Fate of Democracy"
newengland.140.d:0 "Within the Remnant is a still large disagreement over the nature of democracy and its relationship to liberty. The hardline Nockian and Mencken wing of the party viewed democracy as a threat to liberty for the populace would simply vote for hucksters to take away liberty on the back of false promises or redistribution. The other faction of the Remnant which McCormick leans towards simply expanding the Bill of Rights to make income redistribution and populist economics nearly impossible to implement and just have the Remnant become a political party that defends the ideals of the Radicals in democratic election."
newengland.140.a:0 "The Nockian Policy"
newengland.140.b:0 "The Democratic Policy"

newengland.150.t:0 "The Reconstruction of Tammany Hall"
newengland.150.d:0 "Prior to the civil war, Tammany Hall was at the core of the Democratic Party in New York. Viewed by syndicalists as a symbol of bourgeoisie exploitation and corruption, it was torched when the CSA seized the city in the opening days of the war, and would have been completely destroyed had local leaders not redirected the required resources to more pressing matters. Now with New York City in our hands, we must begin to reestablish symbols of liberalism in the area. Local construction magnates have drafted plans to repair the hall, and are simply awaiting government approval."
newengland.150.a:0 "Begin repairs immediately"

###Democracy###

newengland.160.t:0 "Curley Investigated"
newengland.160.d:0 "As apart of our investigation of the political machines in our region, it seems Democratic party leader James Michael Curley is now finally under investigation for corruption, specifically spreading and accepting bribes. This has led to outrage as the Democratic newspapers and Curley himself claim that this is a Republican ploy to undermine their enemies."
newengland.160.a:0 "Let him complain"

newengland.161.t:0 "Philip Bucola Arrested"
newengland.161.d:0 "New England Mob Boss Philip Buccola has been arrested for smuggling, tax evasion, murder and a host of other crimes. While a conviction for the head of the Boston crime family is unlikely it at least represents their dwindling power he could be arrested to begin with and is associated with the arrest of mafia soldiers as well."
newengland.161.a:0 "Good"


###Expansion###

newengland.200.t:0 "New England Demands Land"
newengland.200.d:0 "New England has been a troublesome investment. With a population comparable to our own, they could hinder our plans if we lose their allegiance. They have come to us demanding we cede New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to them. If we accept, they promise greater cooperation with the Entente, and have assured us that they will not join with the victor of the American Civil War, but instead remain within our sphere. If we deny them, it could have greater repercussions..."
newengland.200.a:0 "Let's see where this goes"

NEE_LESLIE_GROVES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 17, 1896, in Albany, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in a family with quite a history in the military, considering his father had served in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines and the Boxer Rebellion. During his late high-school years, Groves started to enroll in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea. He would be assigned several times, becoming commander of Company D of the 1st Engineer Battalion, helping during the New England flood of 1927, being sent to Nicaragua in 1929 to conduct surveys for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, and he being assigned to look over Nicaragua's water supply after the 1931 earthquake. It was upon his return to a shattered United States that he gained his last promotions, rising to the rank of Field Marshall in New England, mainly due to the sheer lack of capable staff in the region.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- A brilliant engineer, he has been following closely the development of Nuclear Fission technology keeping regular contact with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner."
NEE_MERRITT_A_EDSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 25, 1897, in Rutland, Vermont, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Merritt Austin Edson joined the University of Vermont in 1915, and in June 1916 he joined the First Infantry Regiment of the Vermont National Guard, where he was sent to Eagle Pass, Texas to work in the Mexican Border. He'd return to Vermont in September, but some time after returning to his university he signed up for the Marine Corps Reserve. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on October 1917, and would be promoted to first lieutenant in June 1920. He later signed up for the Naval Air Station Pensacola, and earned his gold wings as a naval aviator in 1922. He was later stationed in Guam, where received training on semi-tropical environments and upon returning to the US in 1925, he'd take an advanced aviation tactics course at Kelly Field, Texas. He'd later be sent to Nicaragua to fight against the Sandinista forces, and would return to the United States by late 1929. He has since then become the Coach and captain of the Marine corps National Rifle and Pistol teams, managing to win both the 1935 and 1936 tournaments, despite several interruptions due to the growing social unrest. He was finally promoted to Major in February 1936, and assigned to Philadelphia. With the collapse of the Union into civil war, Merritt hardly managed to reach New England before armies closed down the border towards New England. His experience and fame have granted him an early promotion to the rank of Brigadier General.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Apathetic to politics."
NEE_MARK_CLARK_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in Sackets Harbour, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Mark Wayne Clark was born into a family with a great military history. His grandfather was George Rogers Clark, a military general from the times of the American Revolution, and is the cousin of Army General George Marshall. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point when he was just 17, in 1913, but unfortunately lost time in his career due to his constant illness. In his time in West Point, he met and befriended Dwight Eisenhower, and Clark graduated in April 1917 alongside Matthew Ridgway and J. Lawton Collins as a second lieutenant. Like his grandfather, he chose to serve in the Infantry corps where he was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment. He'd later serve in a variety of staff and training roles, gaining the rank of First Lieutenant in 1921, the rank of Captain in 1925 after completing the professional officer course at the US Army Infantry School, and reached rank of Major in 1933 after being assigned as the training instructor of the Indiana Army National Guard. He served as the deputy commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps district in Omaha, Nebraska while doing courses at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School where he would meet old classmates like Matthew Ridgway once more, as well as meeting Walter Bedell Smith and Geoffrey Keyes, with whom he had a cordial relationship. As the internal situation deteriorated, Clark was on leave in New York, and when hostilities broke out, he moved to New England looking for safety. With the lack of capable staff, Clark has been hastily promoted to Brigadier General, where he'll now have to oversee the creation of a new army.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While his loyalty is unquestioned, his friendship with now enemy Generals have raised concerns that General Clark will be unable to do his duty when the time comes to face them openly on the battlefield."
NEE_WILLARD_G_WYMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 21, 1898, in Augusta, Maine, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Willard Gordon Wyman entered the United States Military Academy in 1917 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Coastal Artillery Branch, and later transferred to the Cavalry Branch of the United States Army. He became an infantry and cavalry instructor in 1921, and would gain valuable experience working as an attaché on China between 1928 and 1932, reaching the rank of Captain upon his return. The lack of capable staff forced an early promotion to Brigadier General for Wyman, but he has shown willingness to learn despite being thrown in such a difficult position."
