POLITICS_ADOLF_FRIEDRICH_DESC:0 "Once could hardly find a place in the world which Adolf Friedrich, the first and only Duke of the United Baltic Duchy, has not seen. An erudite, veteran of the Prussian Cuirassiers, a passionate hunter and an avid car racer, he's undertaken personal pilgrimages to the Middle East, East Asia and Africa, travelling thousands of kilometers on foot and horseback, throughout most of his life. Africa and its lush wildlife hold a special place in his heart, however - he's crossed Africa from east to west, left his name upon a volcano in Tanganyika, and ultimately landed a job as the Governor of Togoland before the Weltkrieg. While definitely not a soft administrator, Adolf Friedrich displayed great interest in the lives and culture of the Togolese natives, even taking the time to learn the Ewe language. \n\nAt the end of the Weltkrieg, his experience as a colonial governor and great prestige among the German upper class led to Adolf von Pilchau's Regency Council offering the throne of the United Baltic Duchy to him. Adolf Friedrich agreed and arrived to Riga in spring of 1919, where he announced that he shall safeguard the ancient rights and privileges of the Baltic nobility and do everything in his power to be a good ruler. For the most part, Duke Adolf Friedrich is a passive monarch who dedicates his institution to patronage of the arts, sciences, and sports. He's been recognized as the best racecar driver in the entire Duchy, surpassing all of his fellow fans of the sport. Years of experience have given him plenty of political acumen, however, and, recognizing the weakness of his new realm, he's begun to speak out more often, expressing the need for reform."

### Events ###

balticduchy.1.t:0 "The United Baltic Duchy"
balticduchy.1.d:0 "Der östliche Schutzwall – that is how the United Baltic Duchy has come to be known. In this rather small client state of the German Empire, the full spectrum of political powers is concentrated within the Baltic German minority, who achieve plurality only in the cities of Riga, Revel, and on the islands of Ösel and Dagö. The rest of the country is populated mainly by Latvians and Estonians."
balticduchy.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
balticduchy.1.b:0 "Let's get started."

balticduchy.2.t:0 "The Duchy's Interior Situation"
balticduchy.2.d:0 "Administratively, the Duchy is subdivided into two cities, Riga and Revel, and four states, which are Öselland, Estland, Livland, and Kurland. The country is very centralised, with the regions having very little power. Moreover, recent tensions with the rural Estonian and Latvian populations have prompted the formation of two specialised security commands for Livland and Estland."
balticduchy.2.a:0 "Just what have I gotten myself into?"
balticduchy.2.b:0 "Let's get started."

balticduchy.3.t:0 "The Duchy's Overall Situation"
balticduchy.3.d:0 "Our Duchy's position is not exactly stable. Lithuania wants sea access, Russia wants its Baltic provinces back, and Finnish nationalists want to see their Estonian brethren liberated. In addition, the lack of strong authority over the states of Estland, Livland, and Kurland severely hampers the economy. Not to mention the outstanding interior problems, which will have to be resolved before future plans can be made."
balticduchy.3.a:0 "Next game, I'm playing Switzerland."

balticduchy.4.t:0 "A new Imperial State!"
balticduchy.4.d:0 "His Highness Adolf Friedrich the First, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and of the United Baltic Duchy, has requested from the Reichstag and the Deutsche Kaiser the recognition of his Baltic domains as a Constituent State of the German Empire."
balticduchy.4.a:0 "A Triple Hurrah for the German Empire!"

balticduchy.5.t:0 "Promised Election"
balticduchy.5.d:0 "The new parliamentary elections are coming and thanks to our new national election system only two parties were able to make into parliament. The highly xenophobic 'Nationalist German Party' and the 'Conservative Party'. The Social Democrats, Baltic Nationalists, and Liberal Democrats didn't get the necessary votes to lead a government."
balticduchy.5.a:0 "Conservative Party it is!"
balticduchy.5.b:0 "Nationalist German Party for me!"

balticduchy.6.t:0 "Birth of Baltic Federation"
balticduchy.6.d:0 "Today, the Ducal Government of the United Baltic Duchy announced that only together can we survive in this cruel world. The old government have shown their incompetence in ruling our country and so Duke Adolf and his supporters have formed a Provisional Government, until such a time as a new government can be elected. Long live the Federation!"
balticduchy.6.a:0 "Unite we stand!"

balticduchy.7.t:0 "Federation Election"
balticduchy.7.d:0 "The new parliamentary elections are coming and thanks to our new national election system only three parties were able to make into parliament. The 'Prosperity Party', the 'All-Baltic Coalition' and the 'Conservative Party'. The highly xenophobic 'Nationalist German Party' and the Liberal Democrats didn't get the necessary votes to lead a government."
balticduchy.7.a:0 "Prosperity Party."
balticduchy.7.b:0 "All-Baltic Coalition."
balticduchy.7.c:0 "Conservative Party."

balticduchy.29.t:0 "Baltic Germans and their Duchy"
balticduchy.29.d:0 "As economic stagnation and recession nears, old feuds between largely urban Germans and rural non-Germans gain new strength. Some propose we should further encourage Germans to settle the land, others wish to integrate the local population fully into the political life. In the end, the choice is in between fully integrating into the Empire or partially emancipating ourselves from Imperial authority."
balticduchy.29.a:0 "Interesting."

balticduchy.30.t:0 "Black Monday hits the United Baltic Duchy!"
balticduchy.30.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached the United Baltic Duchy. German-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Papiermark is losing value, and agricultural exports are shrinking..."
balticduchy.30.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."

balticduchy.51.t:0 "Mutiny of Latvian units"
balticduchy.51.d:0 "As the pessimists predicted, mutiny has started in one of the Latvian-speaking units and now threaten nearly every non-German and non-Estonian unit. Most mutineers want more freedom for the ordinary soldier, better food, higher payment, but radicals speak of 'overthrowing the evil German regime'. We can win over a majority of the mutineers but negotiations will be needed."
balticduchy.51.a:0 "Negotiate with them."
balticduchy.51.b:0 "They don't deserve anything!"

balticduchy.70.t:0 "Nationalist Movements Agitating!"
balticduchy.70.d:0 "The decision of our German masters to speed up the integration of the entire region into the German Empire was met with stern disapproval from the native Latvian and Estonian population. The fight against waves of German settlers, who they believe intend to destroy both nations, has led to various radical nationalist groups to be reactivated.. Their goal is to attain complete freedom from the German Empire."
balticduchy.70.a:0 "Should we be worried?"

balticduchy.72.t:0 "Nationalist Movements Unite"
balticduchy.72.d:0 "Grave news, it seems that our radical pro-German policy forced nationalist Latvian and Estonian movements to unite in order to save the Baltic from German oppression and to establish a free Baltic state. The new united nationalist movement was named Baltic Liberation Front - BLF and it poses a great danger to our state."
balticduchy.72.a:0 "Mein Gott!"

balticduchy.91.t:0 "German settlers in Baltic Federation"
balticduchy.91.d:0 "During the existence of the United Baltic Duchy, thousands of Germans were settled in our frontiers, founding many new farms and villages. With our independence regained, however, we could very well seize those lands and redistribute them amongst our own people! However, such a populist move could harm our fragile economy, as a good part of our agricultural production comes from these farms."
balticduchy.91.a:0 "Seize the farms and expel the Germans."
balticduchy.91.b:0 "Those settlers are important for our economy."

balticduchy.92.t:0 "Refugees from Baltic Confederation"
balticduchy.92.d:0 "During existence of United Baltic Duchy, thousands of German settlers moved to the area of today Baltic Federation. Their newly-independent government has decided to expel them..."
balticduchy.92.a:0 "Oh!"

balticduchy.94.t:0 "Break the Chains"
balticduchy.94.d:0 "We are proud people of Baltic State. Too long were we the lesser minion of the Greater German Empire. Now, it's time for us to break free from our masters..."
balticduchy.94.a:0 "We must wait..."

balticduchy.95.t:0 "Baltic Duchy wants to be more independent from Berlin!"
balticduchy.95.d:0 "Due to rising tensions with Estonians, Latvians, and other minorities deprived of their political rights, Duke Adolf Friedrich has decided to accept their demands. This means that his lands won't be an easy target for German colonisation anymore, but it will also mean one less source of instability for the Ostraum. What is our stance on this?"
balticduchy.95.a:0 "The Parliament approves of this move!"
balticduchy.95.b:0 "The Kaiser is angry at the Duke!"

balticduchy.96.t:0 "The Kaiser is angry!"
balticduchy.96.d:0 "After the Kaiser has expressed his disagreement over the type of administration in the United Baltic Duchy, the majority of Germans feel that the UBD must stay on its democratic course and friendship with Germany. Many of them however think of this is a good excuse to revert everything which has been done."
balticduchy.96.a:0 "Revert everything!"
balticduchy.96.b:0 "Tell Kaiser that this is needed for a better future for the United Baltic Duchy!"

balticduchy.97.t:0 "The Kaiser agrees!"
balticduchy.97.d:0 "Now, we are free. Glory to our proud people. Three hurrah's for them."
balticduchy.97.a:0 "Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!"

balticduchy.98.t:0 "Break the Chains"
balticduchy.98.d:0 "We are proud people of Baltic Federation. Too long were we the lesser minion of the Greater German Empire. Now, it's time for us to break free from our masters..."

balticduchy.170.d:0 "The new parliamentary elections are coming and thanks to our new national election system only two parties were able to make into parliament.

balticduchy.183.d:0 "Our efforts to colonise the Baltic Duchy with German settlers has only been met with resistance.

balticduchy.184.t:0 "Our Baltic brothers"
balticduchy.184.d:0 "Vile imperialists from Germany have dastardly decided to erase all the presence of Baltic nations. More and more German settlers arriving in Baltic Duchy everyday, forcing locals to leave their homes. This policy was met with major discontent between pro-German Ducal government and Native Balts. Resistance movement was established and our brothers have launched an open rebellion against German imperialism. It's our duty too support them in war against bourgeoisie!"
balticduchy.184.a:0 "Send volunteers!"
balticduchy.184.b:0 "We will help them... later."

balticduchy.185.t:0 "Native Rebellion in Baltic Duchy"
balticduchy.185.d:0 "Seems, that German effort to colonise Pribaltika ends in open rebellion against them. Latvian and Estonian people have established their own governments and now struggle to achieve independence. While the situation is unclear, we can help them to fight the Germans, influencing their politicians."
balticduchy.185.a:0 "Send volunteers to both Estonia and Latvia!"
balticduchy.185.b:0 "If Latvia wants our help, they must revoke their claims on us!"

balticduchy.207.d:0 "Newborn Estonia is threatened by Germany. It's a fine opportunity for us to influence their government. However, we don't exactly now how Germans will react on this."

### Focuses ###

BAT_Germanization:0 "Germanisation"
BAT_Germanization_desc:0 "Almost two decades have passed since we achieved our status as a German protectorate. These decades have turned our nation into a German-dominated state, and we must respect their wishes. The Kaiser calls for Germanisation, and we shall follow suit. Drang Nach Osten!"

BAT_Emancipation:0 "Emancipation"
BAT_Emancipation_desc:0 "Almost two decades have passed since we achieved our status as a German protectorate. The Germans dominate our industry, our politics, and our military. We may be Germans too, but the Vaterland is growing weak, it is perhaps our chance to break those ties."

BAT_Ger_Kurland1:0 "Give Land To Veterans"
BAT_Ger_Kurland1_desc:0 "Many of our brothers once proved the might of Prussian discipline and strength of German spirit. Now, some of them have retired from the army to live a peaceful life. With Black Monday ravaging the Vaterland, we can at least give some unused land to our veterans to live and work on in the name of Kaiserreich."

BAT_Ger_Livland1:0 "Found the DOIS"
BAT_Ger_Livland1_desc:0 "Our newly established ministry called "The Ducal Office of Immigration and Settlement" or DOIS will help every poor German from the Vaterland to settle down in our Duchy and begin life anew. Its main goal is to increase the size of the current German minority inside our three provinces."

BAT_Ger_Estland1:0 "Sell the Noble Titles"
BAT_Ger_Estland1_desc:0 "During the Russian Empire era, the Baltic German nobility was the privileged social class in the territories of today's Duchy. Alas, after the Weltkrieg many of the nobles fled the country to the Vaterland. With Black Monday disrupting our economy we can sell some of the titles to gain some extra capital."

BAT_Ger_Kurland2:0 "Establish a Military Academy"
BAT_Ger_Kurland2_desc:0 "As an Imperial client state, we do not have a military academy of our own in which to educate officers. But with recent waves of Weltkrieg veterans settling in our Duchy, a lot of talented and skilled officers are waiting to teach a new generation. We can invest money into our own military academy as part of our reforms."

BAT_Ger_Livland2:0 "Guarantee The Safety of Baltic Farmers"
BAT_Ger_Livland2_desc:0 "We are running out of free land to distribute. Instead of taking Latvian and Estonian farmland, we shall build tenement buildings for workers in cities and force immigrants to live there and work in factories."

BAT_Ger_Estland2:0 "Expropriate Land From Farmers"
BAT_Ger_Estland2_desc:0 "We are out of free land to distribute. A lot of farms are ran by Native Balts and this fact makes us dependent on their crop output. We can, inch by inch, force them to leave these lands in favour of our German immigrants."

BAT_Ger_Baltic:0 "Deutsch-Baltika"
BAT_Ger_Baltic_desc:0 "The process of Germanisation has been successful. The Baltic Germans are now the dominant ethnicity within politics as well as forming a significant minority within the population. We are finally eligible to apply to become an Imperial State, if that is what we want, of course."

BAT_Ger_Integration:0 "Integration"
BAT_Ger_Integration_desc:0 "The Vaterland calls! We are Germans, and our Duchy shall become the 29th Imperial State! A glorious future awaits us under the full protection and oversight of the German Vaterland."

BAT_Ger_Puppet:0 "Status Quo"
BAT_Ger_Puppet_desc:0 "Reuniting with the Vaterland is important, but not a top priority. While we may be Germans, we are Baltic Germans, and we must receive special treatment. Reunification can wait, we must deal with local matters first."

BAT_Ger_Indep:0 "Independence"
BAT_Ger_Indep_desc:0 "The valley between the Vaterland Germans and Baltic Germans will never, and we do mean never, be walked over by the Empire. We, the Germans of Livland, Kurland and Estland, must cease all dealings with the mainland, and declare independence!"

BAT_Ger_Autonomy1:0 "Autonomy Under the Germans"
BAT_Ger_Autonomy1_desc:0 "It is time for us to reform. The conservatives within the Baltic Landtag want to turn the nation into a parliamentary monarchy and abandon the nigh-absolutist practices of Adolf Friedrich I. Should we listen?"

BAT_Ger_Autonomy2:0 "Confronting the Kaiser"
BAT_Ger_Autonomy2_desc:0 "The Vaterland is disappointed. To them, a strong parliamentary Baltic Duchy means a more autonomous and resistant Baltic Duchy. Our relations with the Kaiser have been damaged. It is time we finally confront the Kaiser about our increased political autonomy instead of leaving the resolution of this conflict to chance."

BAT_Ger_Autonomy3:0 "Centralise the Government"
BAT_Ger_Autonomy3_desc:0 "The apparatus of the Ducal government is weak, rife with corruption and heavily decentralised, we must enact substantial governmental reforms before advancing forward, so that our country may prosper even without the help of the Kaiser."

BAT_Ger_Autonomy4:0 "Break the Chains"
BAT_Ger_Autonomy4_desc:0 "The rift between Baltic Germans and the government of the Kaiserreich is growing deeper every day, and we can use this as an opportunity to finally increase our autonomy and maybe even finally obtain free elections for all."

BAT_Ger_Autonomy5:0 "Promises of Democracy"
BAT_Ger_Autonomy5_desc:0 "We have promised the people of the Duchy that the first free elections to the Baltic Landtag are coming soon. The people rejoice that they may finally choose the fate of their country, at least for once."

BAT_Fed1:0 "The Multicultural State"
BAT_Fed1_desc:0 "The Germans are not the only people living in the United Baltic Duchy. Latvians, Estonians and Russians all make up significant portions of the population, too, and they demand to be recognised and represented in the government. We shall consider it."

BAT_Fed2:0 "The Baltic Federation"
BAT_Fed2_desc:0 "Andrevs Niedra, a puppet head of government we placed to pacify the locals, has proposed a seemingly radical idea, reforming the Duchy into a democratic Baltic Federation, where not only Germans, but also the local Balts can have a say in how they are ruled. It seems like a good idea after all."

BAT_Fed3:0 "First Landtag Elections"
BAT_Fed3_desc:0 "We have promised free elections as part of the future of our newly founded Federation, and it is high time for us to fulfil this promise. The Baltic peoples will now finally decide the fate of their country."

BAT_Fed4:0 "Baltic Trade"
BAT_Fed4_desc:0 "The new democratic Baltic state is rife for trade dominance in the Baltic Sea. Our new political course will be beneficial to our trading centres and our port cities, so we must develop them to use this advantage to its fullest."

BAT_Fed5:0 "Independence Referendum"
BAT_Fed5_desc:0 "We had never truly planned to break our ties with Germany, but more and more people are demanding the Baltic Federation to become an independent state. We have found a compromise, an independence referendum. Of course, even with a majority in favour of independence, there's no telling whether the Kaiser will approve."

BAT_Education:0 "Education Reform"
BAT_Education_desc:0 "The large Latvian and Estonian contingent in the Baltic Landtag is demanding a comprehensive education reform. Latvian and Estonian need to be accepted as secondary languages and the discrimination against the local Balts in schools must stop. This seems acceptable."

BAT_Press:0 "A Free Press"
BAT_Press_desc:0 "Ever since the foundation of our nation, there have been severe limitations to the freedom of our press. This has come to light in recent events, and our people want profound reforms. The conservatives oppose these changes, while the liberal faction in the Landtag are in favour of them."

BAT_Lib1:0 "A Liberal Duchy"
BAT_Lib1_desc:0 "The Liberal faction has secured a stable majority coalition in the Landtag, and this faction demands for the Duchy to be liberalised and rid of the worst parts of Imperial and Ducal influence imposed to us by the Vaterland."

BAT_Lib2:0 "Ducal Elections"
BAT_Lib2_desc:0 "The liberals demand a free election to be held for the Landtag! It may seem like a radical proposal, but times are clearly changing. The near absolutism we used to live in may no longer endure as democracy once again shines on the horizon of Europe."

BAT_Lib3:0 "Cultural Equality"
BAT_Lib3_desc:0 "Germans, Latvians, Estonians and Russians; we are all the same. We must follow the principles of equality and extend the rights of cultural autonomy to all nations within the state. Even if the Baltic Germans are to remain dominant, of course."

BAT_Lib4:0 "Economic Liberalisation"
BAT_Lib4_desc:0 "The liberal faction believes that the state must interfere as little as possible in the affairs of the economy, and this outlook has attracted lots of private investment into our nation. The economy may grow freely, for we will reap the rewards quickly."

BAT_ERP:0 "Economic Recovery Plan"
BAT_ERP_desc:0 "The crisis known as Black Monday has caused many troubles for our economy. More than fifty thousand people had lost their jobs at the end of first day. We have got to do something, and our ministers are already preparing a plan to save our economy."

BAT_ERP_Gov1:0 "Government Intervention"
BAT_ERP_Gov1_desc:0 "We cannot allow this stagnation to continue. The government should assume control of all the major facilities. It is a harsh policy that will surely stifle our private sector, but it will steer our economy out of trouble."

BAT_ERP_Gov2:0 "Build Up Our Roads"
BAT_ERP_Gov2_desc:0 "Many unemployed citizens are trying to find any kind of job. We can help them by involving them in infrastructure development. They will build up our roads and we will pay them. This way we can kill two birds with one stone."

BAT_ERP_Gov3:0 "Social Investments"
BAT_ERP_Gov3_desc:0 "To solve our economic problems, we need a stable society. Some benefits for the poorest in our Duchy should be established. Everybody deserves at least basic economic security, and this will help maintain order in our population."

BAT_ERP_Gov4:0 "Baltic Arsenals"
BAT_ERP_Gov4_desc:0 "Our country has always had a problem with the military sector. Now, with many free hands available, we can send them to military factories to produce guns, tanks and aircraft. This again should solve many problems at once."

BAT_Eco_Naval1:0 "Baltic Dockyards"
BAT_Eco_Naval1_desc:0 "We are a coastal country, almost half of our land borders the Baltic sea. Now, with many free hands available, we can send them to dockyards to build up our fleet. A large and prosperous Baltic navy, we shall raise."

BAT_Eco_Naval2:0 "Baltic Trade League"
BAT_Eco_Naval2_desc:0 "There are many countries around the Baltic sea. We desperately need new trade partners, and they can indeed be very good trade partners to us. We should establish new trade routes in the Baltic sea."

BAT_Eco_Naval3:0 "Found the SEF"
BAT_Eco_Naval3_desc:0 "A recent breakthrough in communication technologies shows importance of electronics both in military communication and civil life. We must be as advanced as the world's most powerful hegemons. In order to produce high-tech electronics, a brand new facility named "Staatliche Elektrotechnische Fabrik" or SEF shall be built."

BAT_ERP_FM1:0 "Rely on Local Businesses"
BAT_ERP_FM1_desc:0 "We cannot allow this stagnation to continue. If we enact strong laissez-faire policies, it will open many opportunities for local businesses and the private sector. Our capitalists and the free market will save the economy."

BAT_ERP_FM2:0 "Invest in Our Scientists"
BAT_ERP_FM2_desc:0 "Every prosperous country has to rely on its scientists. We have to invest in our future now for a brighter tomorrow. Knowledge will always be a powerful weapon, and a source of economic and social prosperity."

BAT_ERP_FM3:0 "Social Investments"
BAT_ERP_FM3_desc:0 "To solve our economic problems we need a stable society. Some benefits for the poorest in our Duchy should be established; everybody deserves at least basic economic security; and this will help maintain order in our population."

BAT_ERP_FM4:0 "Political Establishment"
BAT_ERP_FM4_desc:0 "Our capitalists are becoming more and more powerful, even starting to influence our politics. If we let them capitalise on that political clout, they will become important and trustworthy allies."

BAT_ERP_End:0 "Recovery from Crisis"
BAT_ERP_End_desc:0 "Hurrah! Under our wise rule the Duchy has survived this crisis. It seems, at least for us, that the worst of Black Monday is over. Prosperity is once more the law of the land and it shall stay so!"

BAT_Army_Start:0 "Baltic Army"
BAT_Army_Start_desc:0 "Officially, we do have an army. But it actually consists of nothing more than a bunch of young boys with rifles. Military doctrine is the first thing we need to modernise. Decades have passed since the end of the Weltkrieg and our current doctrine is now clearly outdated."

BAT_Army_Cons:0 "Sons of Vaterland"
BAT_Army_Cons_desc:0 "Native Balts, the majority of our country's population, are not currently allowed to serve in the army. And we will rather die than allow them to do it. We are proud sons of Vaterland and our army must be entirely German."

BAT_Army_Cons3:0 "All-Baltic Army"
BAT_Army_Cons3_desc:0 "Native Balts, the majority of our country's population, are not currently allowed to serve in the army. With the need for an ever-expanding standing force however, this must begin to change. While the core of the Army should remain German as there are some roles Balts simply cannot be trusted to fill, we need more men desperately and some reforms must be introduced."

BAT_Army_Cons2:0 "Balts to Serve"
BAT_Army_Cons2_desc:0 "Native Balts, the majority of our country's population, are not currently allowed to serve in the army. But now we need every man on the front line, no matter who is he: German, Estonian, Latvian or Russian. The people of the Baltic Duchy must defend their homes and there is no time for xenophobic bias."

BAT_Army_Inf1:0 "Modern Equipment"
BAT_Army_Inf1_desc:0 "Most of our troops use clearly obsolete equipment. The Weltkrieg is long over, we need to change our equipment so that our brave soldiers fight with the best money and technology has to offer. We are a militia no more!"

BAT_Army_Inf2:0 "Improve our Training System"
BAT_Army_Inf2_desc:0 "We should reorganise and modernise our training system. New drilling methods will shorten boot camp times and stronger emphasis on actual combat training will increase the combat readiness of our troops."

BAT_Army_Doc1:0 "War Games"
BAT_Army_Doc1_desc:0 "Our military staff still push for old tactics and doctrines. We desperately need to change their minds. If we start organising regular war games, we will slowly but surely force them to adapt to the realities of modern warfare."

BAT_Army_Doc2:0 "Modern Doctrine Effort"
BAT_Army_Doc2_desc:0 "Now our generals are prepared for the realities of today's warfare. But even better, they now seem to have finally adopted a more innovative and forward-thinking mindset. Let us warmly welcome any suggestions from them, and seek new tactics to implement."

BAT_Army_Mot:0 "Mobile Army"
BAT_Army_Mot_desc:0 "We can significantly improve the speed of our troops by simply adopting motorised vehicles as an integral part of our division design. These new troops will be attached to their trucks as cavalry were with their horses, now we just need to figure out the tactical and organisational details."

BAT_Army_Arm:0 "Armour Blueprints"
BAT_Army_Arm_desc:0 "It seems that tanks become more and more powerful and practical every day, not that the Weltkrieg had not already showcased their potential by shattering the tactics of trench warfare. Every modern army will come to rely on them, and so should we. We will build our own."

BAT_Army_Def1:0 "Modern Artillery"
BAT_Army_Def1_desc:0 "The artillery cannon will always be useful. But as any kind of equipment, we should seek to modernise it. New artillery will be even more powerful than we can yet imagine, with bigger calibres, bigger guns, and bigger payloads."

BAT_Army_Mil_Navy1:0 "Baltic Fleet"
BAT_Army_Mil_Navy1_desc:0 "Since Peter the Great many naval battles have been fought in the Baltic Sea; we are proud of the prestige and legacy of our navy and we will focus on improving our ships even more."

BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Old:0 "Naval Traditions"
BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Old_desc:0 "The power of our navy lies in its traditions. Instead of investing endless funds into new hulls, we can always improve and refit our old ships. A battleship shall always be a battleship."

BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_New:0 "New Naval Technologies"
BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_New_desc:0 "Traditions are good, but we can't afford to forget about new technologies. Instead of praising the old ways, we should invest our funds into some brand new naval technologies like submarines."

BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Doc:0 "Our Brave Officers"
BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Doc_desc:0 "Our naval officers are some of the best officers of Europe. We should encourage them and create more favourable working conditions for them to encourage them to stay and improve our navy."

BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Transport:0 "Elite Baltic Marines"
BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Transport_desc:0 "With our long coastline, we will always be threatened by naval invasions. We should teach some of our troops to fight in such conditions and even perform autonomous naval landings."

BAT_Air1:0 "Expand Air Bases"
BAT_Air1_desc:0 "Aviation never was our forte; ever since the introduction of aeroplanes during the Weltkrieg we have been struggling to catch up. We should build some airfields now and start training for the future of warfare."

BAT_Air_CAS:0 "CAS Effort"
BAT_Air_CAS_desc:0 "A modern army needs support from vehicles not only on the ground but also in the air; certainly a concept which will be easy for our officers to understand."

BAT_Air_Fighter:0 "Fighter Effort"
BAT_Air_Fighter_desc:0 "We have not seen the last of the Weltkrieg's dogfights. Keeping ahead in the development of fighter planes will give us an edge in future air battles."

BAT_Air_Nav_Bomber:0 "Naval Bomber Effort"
BAT_Air_Nav_Bomber_desc:0 "Ships have proven exceptionally vulnerable to aircrafts. We should keep improving on their technology to ensure we stay ahead of any countermeasures and get the edge in large naval confrontations."

BAT_Air_Doc:0 "Air Innovations"
BAT_Air_Doc_desc:0 "Modern wars cannot be won without dominating the skies. We must do everything in our power to develop the air force until we are able to protect our skies as well as we protect our seas and lands!"

BAT_Air_End:0 "Baltic Aviation"
BAT_Air_End_desc:0 "Now, that is what we call aviation. Our recent efforts have shown very impressive results. Maybe we are not the kings of the sky but our pilots can fight well enough to give any enemy plane a run for his money."

BAT_Education_Ger:0 "Education Reform"
BAT_Education_Ger_desc:0 "With more power to the Duke, the time has come for us to rethink our system of education. We have made some great strides in educating the younger masses, but our universities are already full. If we invest some money and open more universities, more people will get a higher education."

### Ideas ###

BAT_multi_ling:0 "Political Instability"
BAT_multi_ling_desc:0 "Our country is a union of multiple cultures. The Native Balts, the Germanised Balts and the Russian minorities all vie for political influence, causing regular conflict and difficulty to set a common policy. This is only made much worse by the German dominance caused by the Kaiser's policies of Germanisation, crushing minority rights."

BAT_start_crisis:0 "Conscription Crisis"
BAT_start_crisis_desc:0 "Only people of German descent or having sufficiently Germanised are allowed into the armed forces. Naturally, as the majority of the people in our country are Native Balts and resistance to Germanisation is still high, this poses massive conscription issues. However, due to significant unrest and the ever present risk of a revolt, this is currently seen as a necessary evil."

BAT_multi_ling_aut:0 "Minor Autonomy"
BAT_multi_ling_aut_desc:0 "Following some diplomatic manoeuvring, we have successfully put an end to the Kaiser's plans of Germanisation. Our country is still shattered, but our people are grateful that we saved our minorities from cultural indoctrination. These wounds will take time to heal, but at least they will be able to heal."

BAT_german_majority:0 "Solidified Minority Rule"
BAT_german_majority_desc:0 "Following a recent push for Germanisation, we have finally achieved a significant milestone. The German minority has been strengthened, ensuring greater stability as it rules over the other cultures."

BAT_schools:0 "New Education System"
BAT_schools_desc:0 "Reforming our education system is easier said than done. But with some improvements made to our curriculum, we expect that our country's literacy will increase, and higher education will eventually become a reality to a larger part of our youth, with benefits all across our society."

BAT_factory:0 "Economic Boom"
BAT_factory_desc:0 "The liberalisation of our economy has had the effect that we hoped, with construction and production once again roaring through our lands. This allows us to contract our newly-recovered economy to perform major infrastructure works, faster and cheaper."

BAT_militia:0 "Baltic Militia"
BAT_militia_desc:0 "With the mighty German army promising to defend our country against aggression, the organisation of our country's military from its very inception has been relaxed, to say the least. We need to remedy to this, wherever we are to still benefit of Germany's protection, or especially if we are to lose it."

BAT_Black_Monday:0 "Aftermath of Black Monday"
BAT_Black_Monday_desc:0 "As a country deeply within the Kaiserreich's sphere of influence, the impact of Black Monday has been brutal to our economy. However, we cannot wait for Germany to fix her own economy, there is work to be done at home. The unrest cannot be ignored, and might be costly if left to boil."

BAT_gov_goods:0 "Social Investments"
BAT_gov_goods_desc:0 "State welfare is turning out to be one of the most important policies we have to help our people cope with this crisis. This also creates a situation where the poorest of our society can now prosper in our country, allowing us to slowly scale down the emergency programs."

BAT_heavy_industry:0 "Baltic Workers"
BAT_heavy_industry_desc:0 "With the effort of some of our people redirected to military factories, we have finally managed to improve our production of military hardware. This will create a skilled and dedicated military workforce on the long run. If some are to be believed, one that will come handy sooner than desired."

BAT_scientists:0 "New Scientists"
BAT_scientists_desc:0 "Scientific discoveries don't just magically appear out of thin air. By investing heavily in scientific pursuits even in times of trouble, we encourage our scientists and research teams to give the best for our country, and merely give them the means to do so."

BAT_pol:0 "Political Establishment"
BAT_pol_desc:0 "There might be those who decry the new influence of some capitalists on our economy, but this direct connection of the political and economic worlds allow us to strengthen our decision-making and help influence our nation's economy, for the better."

BAT_drill:0 "Modern Training System"
BAT_drill_desc:0 "Training a soldier is more complex than teaching him how to shoot his rifle and throw his hand grenades. By perfecting our drill system; we can make boot camp faster, more efficient at turning the average citizen into a competent soldier, and thus capable of more rapidly mobilising new divisions, even those of a new concept to us."

BAT_fort:0 "Ostwall Fortifications Network"
BAT_fort_desc:0 "The Ostwall is more than a few isolated bunkers. A complex and carefully designed network of fortification works, integrating natural choke-points and artificial constructions alike, it will prove a challenge to any invading forces. Likewise, it will also help us design future expansions, and even brand new fortification lines."

BAT_balts_rebellion:0 "Balts Uprising"
BAT_balts_rebellion_desc:0 "Our policy of colonisation caused an uprising among the Native Balts. We surely can handle this ourselves and not involve the Vaterland in our political situation (It's recommended not to call Germany into war).\n\n§YThe Duchy will fall if it loses Riga and Reval.§!"

BAT_ger_army:0 "Sons of Vaterland"
BAT_ger_army_desc:0 "Native Balts, the majority of our country's population, are not currently allowed to serve in the army. And we would rather die than allow them to do so. We are proud sons of the Vaterland and our army must be a full German."

BAT_mixed_army:0 "All-Baltic Army"
BAT_mixed_army_desc:0 "Native Balts, the majority of our country's population, were not allowed to serve in the army. But now we need every man on the front line, no matter who is he: German, Estonian, Latvian or Russian. The people of Baltic Duchy must defend their homes and there is no time for xenophobic bias."

BAT_balts_army:0 "Balts to Serve"
BAT_balts_army_desc:0 "Native Balts, the majority of our country's population, are not currently allowed to serve in the army. Too many times were Germans used to fight and too many of them have died on the battlefields. We should keep them away from service if we want a new generation of proud sons of the Vaterland."

BAT_colonisation:0 "Drang Nach Osten"
BAT_colonisation_desc:0 "Der östliche Schutzwall des Kaiserreichs, is how the United Baltic Duchy has come to be known. In this rather small client state of the German Empire, the full spectrum of political powers is concentrated within the tiny Baltic German minority, who live mainly in the cities of Riga, Revel, and on the islands of Ösel and Dagö. The rest of the country is populated mainly by Latvians and Estonians.\n\n§YFull Germanisation Progress: [?germanisation_var]%§!"
BAT_kurland:0 "Kurland Colonisation"
BAT_kurland_desc:0 "The Ducal Office of Immigration and Settlement has reported an important number of applications for the colonist subsidies. The area of settlement appears to be Kurland, close to the border with Memelland in the Empire proper. This can only come as good news to us and bad news for wannabe rebels and troublemakers playing the false card of national identity!"
BAT_livland:0 "Livland Colonisation"
BAT_livland_desc:0 "The Ducal Office of Immigration and Settlement has indicated that the number of subsidy applications for settlers aiming to establish themselves in Livland has been steadily growing. This can be explained by both an increased confidence that the Ducal government can efficiently defend the interests of colonists, as well as by the important number of colonists already in Livland."
BAT_estland:0 "Estland Colonisation"
BAT_estland_desc:0 "The Ducal Office of Immigration and Settlement has indicated that the number of subsidy applications for settlers aiming to establish themselves in Estland has been steadily growing. This can be explained by both an increased confidence that the Ducal government can efficiently defend the interests of colonists, as well as by the important number of colonists already in Estland."

BAT_army_crisis:0 "Army Reforms"
BAT_army_crisis_desc:0 "As the reforms go forward, some generals want to introduce the recruitment of 'natives' or, speaking the new language, Latvians and Estonians. The Ministry of War has stated that none should be able to exceed low-ranking officer positions."
BAT_ger_high_military:0 "German Officers"
