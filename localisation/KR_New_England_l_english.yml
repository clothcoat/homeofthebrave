### Parties ###
NEE_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
NEE_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - Essentially an extension of the CSA, the Totalist members of the New England SPA want for workers to unite with the Combined Syndicates of America or, it fails, take up its mantle. The Totalist faction of the SPA is notable for having heavier utopian 'Communist' and Bolshevik influence than other Totalists and often reject National Totalism. Nonetheless like the rest of New England SPA they are thought to be too weak to hold power on their own and would surely simply desire to see the CSA annex the territory."
NEE_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
NEE_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America  -  Essentially an extension of the CSA, the syndicalist members of the New England SPA want for workers to unite with the Combined Syndicates of America or, it fails, take up its mantle. The While usually orthodox members of the IWW or anarchist Utopians, like the rest of New England SPA they are thought to be too weak to hold power on their own and would surely simply desire to see the CSA annex the territory."
NEE_radical_socialist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
NEE_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - Essentially an extension of the CSA, the 'Old Guard' members of the New England SPA were once relative moderates who were pushed somewhat left by the Wilson administrations crackdowns and now support cautiously uniting with the Combined Syndicates of America. Their craft union base and more mild positions (by SPA standards) make them more palitable to much of New England and usually their de facto representatives the in the region for that very reason, however like the rest of the New England SPA they are thought to be too weak to hold power on their own and would surely simply desire to see the CSA annex the territory"
NEE_social_democrat_party:0 "National Party"
NEE_social_democrat_party_long:0 "National Party - The newly-formed National Party is made up of disgruntled Republican and Democratic voters, as well as some independents, who typically agree with the party's progressive platform. The National Party has made various appeals to both farmers and industrial workers, hoping to implement a form of crop insurance and to break monopolies. Eventually, one of the party's goals is to have full employment, so as to combat the Great Depression. The party's rising stars include George Aiken and Frances Perkins, and these figures hope to guide New England through this troubled time."
NEE_social_liberal_party:0 "Liberal Republican Party"
NEE_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Liberal Republican Party - When the Intervention occurred, the Republican Party in New England was nearly destroyed. Now, as party officials attempt to put the pieces back together, there are increasing tensions over the party platform. Those more socially liberal-minded members of the party have split from the main party and are now calling themselves the Republican Party, though others have come to term them the "Liberal Republican Party". William Averall Harriman is the party standardbearer for the time being, but others have emerged in hopes of challenging him in the long term. Herbert H. Lehman, John Gilbert Winant, and powerful politician Thomas Dewey all hope to gain a spot at the head of the party, but time will tell to see which of these men will earn it. In the meantime, the party's espousal of education, a program of Social Security, and anti-corruption has made them popular with New Englanders, but with a split party, they may encounter difficulties in winning an election outright."
NEE_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
NEE_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party - The battered Republican Party has started to re-form, but it is not the same party that existed before. Now, more laissez-faire minded liberals in the party argue with those who are more in favor of government intervention and social policy. The divide has caused a split in the party, and now the laissez-faire wing, represented first and foremost by Percival P. Baxter, finds itself alone. Baxter leads the party for now, but in the upcoming elections, he will face challenges from Hamilton Fish III, Joseph William Martin Jr., and Christian Herter, all fairly unknown politicians. Any of the three could rise in prominence in coming years however, and the path the party takes may depend on who leads it, and what happens to the other faction of the Republican Party. For now, the Republicans must face a united Democratic Party in the coming races, and will struggle to maintain power in many parts of New England."
NEE_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
NEE_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party of New England is both renowned and infamous for it's extreme reliance on political machines (even by the standards of the rest of the nation), mainly the ones in Massachusetts and urban regions. With a strong working class, Catholic and immigrant voter base they semi-openly promote using the patronage system for the public good and often argue it allows a way for the common man to have more direct ties with political leaders through their local machines. Recently they have taken the most moderate stance towards foreign policy with regards to other parties, seemingly wanting to unite America if the opportunity arises but otherwise wanting to stay out of the war, and only maintaining relations with the Entente if it's useful. However given their non-ideological nature all are aware this could change in the future."
NEE_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "The Federalist Party"
NEE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "The Federalist Party - The Federalist Party did not begin as such, being made up of those in the parties (and business) who favored closer ties with Canada and looking upon them for protection. Lead largely by American 'aristocrats' of Anglo-Saxon descent such as the Vanderbilt and Astor families, the 'The Committee to Defend America and the Crown' gradually merged with pro-Canadian business interests in the region until it became the leading pro-Entente group in the nation. Eventually as New England became besieged by syndicalism and the Radical Coalition, heavier political influence was needed and the alliance took the name of the old Federalist Party, a far older New England based party that was likewise pro-British. Viewing Canada as their best hope of beating back syndicalism and enriching New England, the Federalist Party half-expects to be appointed as the leaders of New England by Canada as a reward for their loyalism."
NEE_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "The Remnant"
NEE_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Radical Coalition (The Remnant) - The remnant is named for a loose grouping of activists whom self-identify as old-school radicals, with their intellectual leader being Albert Jay Nock. Often openly skeptical of democracy, the Remnant is nonetheless opposed to state intervention in individual lives except to protect base rights through the justice system. Supported by extremely prominent intellectuals such as H.L. Mencken, the Remnant's middle and upper class supporters have grown in reaction to the perceived failures of the government and their role in destabilizing America, opposing Canadian influence in New England and as a reaction against the growth of populism and socialism, with them having a small volunteer militia to protect their rights from its perceived various enemies. Nonetheless, the Remnant itself is still deeply divided on whether democracy should play in the Republic or if voters supporting interventionism and control is simply too dangerous to liberty."
NEE_national_populist_party:0 "The Sentinels of the Republic"
NEE_national_populist_party_long:0 "Radical Coalition (The Sentinels of the Republic) - The more extreme wing of the Radical Coalition, the Sentinels of the Republic began as a lobbying group fighting virtually all forms of government intervention in the economy in opposition to socialism before going through a series of internal radicalizations in the face of increasingly popular redistribution movements and attacks on the upper-class, influenced by the Remnant and New England's right-wing before adopting Alfred Sloan's arguments for the efficiency of unrestrained capitalism. In recent years the powerful DuPont family has taken charge of the organization, allowing greater Social Darwinist influences and using 'Tuckerist' arguments against not only socialists but even Remnant positions and the state itself which they view as too constraining, something old-school Tuckerists have decidedly mixed feelings about when seeing their positions merged with other Sentinel ones. Also among this faction is none other than Lothrop Stoddard, the nation's prime Eugenicist whose writing has made him famous. Though Stoddard may agree with the Sentinels on many issues, particularly social darwinism, he has his own vision of how the country should be run, and he hopes to someday gain power through his 'Nordic League'. For now though, Stoddard is on the fringes of an already extreme faction."

NEE_ULTRA_MARK_LIB_long:0 "The Radical Party"
NEE_ULTRA_MARK_LIB_party:0 "Radical Party"

NEE_Nordic_League_party:0 "The Nordic League"
NEE_Nordic_League_party_long:0 "The Nordic League is a faction primarily led by the author and eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard. Drawing on the ideas of Charles Darwin, Francis Galton, Professor W. Z. Ripley, and more, the party advocates a society in which a "Neo-Aristocracy" rules. This class would be made up of superior men and women, and would be accessible through merit. Ideally, such a society would have significant class mobility so that this would be possible, however, the degenerate and mediocre elements of society must, in Stoddard's view, have a different future. Purification of society can only be achieved through segregation and sterilization of these destructive groups. Further, Stoddard envisions the complete destruction of the violent Syndicalist ideology. He has termed supporters of this and other leftist ideologies as "Undermen" and warns that seek to revolt against the natural fabric of society itself. As such, nothing short of complete annihilation of these groups will be enough to save civilization. There is much work to be done, but Stoddard believes he has just the right tools to usher mankind into a new era."

NEE_Dominionist_party:0 "Office of the Governor General"
NEE_Dominionist_party_long:0 "The Office of the Governor General serves as Ottawa's representative in Boston. The governor-generals of New England will rule as the King sees fit, albeit it with some autonomy.

NEE_minimum_wage_desc:0 "While a higher minimum wage will make some goods more expensive it will protect workers from being underpaid by business owners and allow them to spend more of their hard earned cash."
NEE_Georgist_Taxation:0 "Georgist Taxation"
NEE_Georgist_Taxation_desc:0 "The Land Value Tax is the only tax in our nation and operates by extracting the full rent from the unimproved value of the land, as estimated by land evaluaters. This overwhelmingly falls on the wealthy and allows for unproductive economic forces such as land speculation to be taxed while not taxing productive activities such as improvements to land or work income. However, it being the only tax makes certain forms of social engineering more difficult."
NEE_free_market:0 "Laissez-Faires Capitalism"
NEE_free_market_desc:0 "The market has truly been freed! While this will help maximize consumer goods and grant further economic freedoms to the population it is less popular with some existing political and social institutions, including workers and businessmen whom previously looked to the state for protection."

NEE_state_militias:0 "State Militias"
NEE_state_militias_desc:0 "The majority of our forces are raised through the states rather than on the Federal Level. This makes large scale planning more difficult but also means locals tend to feel more connected to the areas they are defending and more intimate with the environment there."
NEE_private_defense_forces:0 "Private Defense Forces"
NEE_private_defense_forces_desc:0 "We have dismantled the taxpayer funded military and kept on as many former military men as possible as private defense contractors. While it is far more difficult to afford large numbers of soldiers under this system it does cause the Sentinels to focos on quality over quantity, especially more experienced soldiers whom promise to be worth the price. Soldiers are generally better motivated by the opportunity for higher wages as well if they rise in the ranks."
NEE_stateless_capitalism:0 "Stateless Capitalism"
NEE_stateless_capitalism_desc:0 "The tyrannical state has finally been dismantled!

NEE_imperial_propaganda_idea:0 "Pro-Imperial Propaganda"
NEE_imperial_propaganda_idea_desc:0 "To help entrench our position in New England, we have begun to employ various forms of propaganda to convince our people that our cause is a righteous one. After all, we know what we must do in both America and Europe in order to keep our people safe, but they are often against such ideas, or worse, apathetic. Such political malpractice cannot be tolerated and we will ensure our people know that their lives are on the line in the coming wars, whether they choose to fight or not."
NEE_jointexercise_idea:0 "Entente Coordination"
NEE_jointexercise_idea_desc:0 "We have conducted various exercises with our allies in Canada and the rest of the Entente, and our military is significantly better off for it. We are more prepared for war than we would have been otherwise and the Canadians have taught us new tactics to use on the battlefield."
NEE_imperial_loyalty_idea:0 "Imperial System"
NEE_imperial_loyalty_idea_desc:0 "Though we still have some semblance of the old federal system, New England is largely an imperial system now, like any other dominion would be. With the Governor-General at the head of our dominion and more money than we know what to do with, we can repay the Canadians for their help and also experience benefits of our own for our loyalty."
NEE_prodigal_son_idea:0 "The Imperial Prodigy"
NEE_prodigal_son_idea_desc:0 "With our place in the empire firmly cemented, we have become the jewel of the Entente. Citizens in dominions around the world look to our people as examples of how loyal British citiziens should act, and even the French have good things to say about us. We have truly become a New England." 
NEE_reoriented_trade_idea:0 "New Trading Priorities"
NEE_reoriented_trade_idea_desc:0 "With our new status as a dominion, we have begun to turn away from our neighbors to the south and instead trade more with the Canadians and the rest of the Entente. This trade is much more fruitful for us, and they have provided us with everything we need in our imports.

NEE_reoriented_trade_two_idea:0 "The Tea Trade"

NEE_naval_growth_idea:0 "Naval Growth"
NEE_naval_growth_idea_desc:0 "With the help of the Canadians, we will build a New English navy. Though it will mostly involve smaller vessels for now, these ships will help us retain our speed in the ocean and meanwhile wait for the larger Entente ships to arrive to help. We shall do our part in protecting the empire's interests!"
NEE_marine_tech_idea:0 "The Royal Marines"
NEE_marine_tech_idea_desc:0 "The new academy in Boston will help our amphibious forces, particularly our marines, train and become more effective than ever before. Since Canada's main focus is retaking the Home Isles, this will be a helpful investment for their war effort, to say the least. With our men now as prepared as the rest of the Entente, we will be able to contribute more effectively to the war effort."
NEE_racial_science:0 "Confidence in Science"
NEE_racial_science_desc:0 "Our ideology originated with the work of Charles Darwin and continued with Francis Galton.

NEE_reclamation_idea:0 "The Reclamation Effort"
NEE_reclamation_idea_desc:0 "In preparation for the Reclamation of Europe, we must prepare so that we can do our part in the Entente cause.

NEE_abcl_idea:0 "National Birth Control"
NEE_abcl_idea_desc:0 "We have endorsed the American Birth Control League on a national basis and will give them government resources so that they can act with maximum efficiency.

NEE_segregation_sterilization_idea:0 "Segregation and Sterilization"
NEE_segregation_sterilization_idea_desc:0 "We have begun the process of separation in our society, between the degenerates and the superior men and women who make our civilization possible.

NEE_hereditary_intelligence_idea:0 "Hereditary Intelligence"
NEE_hereditary_intelligence_idea_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to segregate the degenerate elements of our population, it is time to emphasize the factor of hereditary intelligence.

You are only as talented as you are at birth, and we will begin testing our citizens to see who possesses this natural gift and who does not!"
NEE_meritocratic_society:0 "Aristocracy of Merit"
NEE_meritocratic_society_desc:0 "Though Stoddard knows that purifying society and creating a new superior society of merit will take generations, we have begun the work of re-establishing legitimacy for aristocratic ideas and have begun to promote through merit, though with racial prerequisites of course..."
NEE_meritocratic_society_two:0 "Growing the Superior Genepool"
NEE_meritocratic_society_two_desc:0 "We have instilled the values of aristocracy in our people, and now it is time to encourage the reproduction of superior genes.

NEE_meritocratic_society_three:0 "Family Subsidies"
NEE_meritocratic_society_three_desc:0 "To help bolster our population, we will introduce new subisides for families of superior quality. These families will be granted free healthcare after achieving the standards we put out for them, and will also enjoy high-quality education in our best schools, education that will cost very little for them assuming they meet our racial and economic standards. Through this, we will promote merit and encourage population growth, and our country will prosper."
NEE_stomping_undermen_idea:0 "Suppressing the Undermen"
NEE_stomping_undermen_idea_desc:0 "We have taken great care to suppress any leftist elements that threaten to cause a violent revolution in our society. These Syndicalists know nothing but barbarism, and our people will stand strong in fending them off!"

We have only succeeded in escaping from the terror by the grace of the British Empire but even our future looks troubled as it is only a matter of time before the ideologically clashing blocs of the South look Northwards, ready to take back what they see as their rightful land.\n\nIt is for them that we must be prepared and defence systems must be created from the Hudson River to the streets of Boston.

NEE_bribe_foreign_press:0 "'Motivate' the Foreign Press"
NEE_bribe_foreign_press_desc:0 "Journalists from all sides of the world keep having this annoying habit of reporting news within our nation as matters of the 'New Englander' state with socialist-aligned papers even going so far as calling us the Canadian Province of New England. This will no longer do for we will not be trifled with and they shall soon recognise that the only true American nation is ours.

NEE_foreign_representation:0 "Increase Foreign Representation in R&D"

NEE_indirectrulefromottawa_desc:0 "Unwilling to allow radicals to take power in this new extension of the Entente, the Canadian military intervened to forestall a populist takeover of New England. Given the rather uncertain outcome of democracy in the region, they have instead installed a Governor-General with emergency powers “for the duration of the emergency.” This Governor-General has been chosen from local stock and will rule in the King's stead."
NEE_rootouttroublemakers:0 "Root Out Troublemakers"
NEE_rootouttroublemakers_desc:0 "The problem with the Provisional Government was that New England’s leaders let their people make a choice in a time of great change and fear. People’s faculties are not where they should be, and they cannot be trusted to make decisions that impact their future. With that being said, thank God for the Canadians! In loyalty to our northern benefactor, we have begun helping the RMCP round up the Remnant, the Sentinels, and all the other stubborn so-called patriots resisting Canada’s help."
NEE_awardroyaltitles:0 "Award Royal Titles"
NEE_awardroyaltitles_desc:0 "New England is home to splendidly wealthy families who take great care to trace their lines back to England, and many of the most powerful men in America found refuge in the Northeast when the civil war broke out.

NEE_empowerthegovernorgeneral:0 "Empower the Governor-General"
NEE_empowerthegovernorgeneral_desc:0 "The Governor-General position is, of course, temporary, as all patriotic New Englanders know. But, so long as it is necessary, it must be a position capable of shepherding New England and defending imperial interests. Executive power will flow from the office of the Governor-General and the “other” governors of New English states will have to smile and tolerate it."
NEE_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
NEE_martial_law_desc:0 "Sometimes, harsh measures are needed. New England is teetering on the edge of radicalism, and it is time for us to call for Canadian help.

NEE_request_reinforcements:0 "Request Reinforcements"
NEE_request_reinforcements_desc:0 "New England is as vulnerable to enemies from within as it is to those from abroad.

NEE_oath_of_loyalty:0 "Oath of Loyalty"
NEE_oath_of_loyalty_desc:0 "Our administration, however much we might sometimes dislike it, relies on the support of local bureaucrats and elected officials who were in power before Canada intervened. The problem is that these folks might not have the interests of our administration at heart. However, if we were to force them to pledge loyalty to our government, we could get rid of those "principled" enough to refuse it."
NEE_pro_imperial_propaganda:0 "Imperial Propaganda"
NEE_pro_imperial_propaganda_desc:0 "The twenties and thirties were not kind on the USA. New England, relatively isolated, started looking to its northern neighbor, Canada, for help. As a result, many across the states of New England have already accepted the necessity of the Canadian intervention, yet many see it as a foreign occupation. We must aim to conquer the hearts and minds of these people, and help them see the necessity of the intervention."

NEE_prepare_to_move_south_desc:0 "We are now sufficiently prepared for war. Weary and exhausted armies fight to our south, and they would be taken off guard if Canada decided to intervene. Our army is fresh and modern, and we are ready to protect our homes. Canada always planned to strike if the Syndicalists were too strong, but regardless, we must fortify the New England border. In terms of offense, the element of surprise and underestimation of our armies are our strengths. Slowly but surely, we will funnel men and resources to our border, and if the need arises, we will strike, and finally, take control."
NEE_the_american_question:0 "The American Question"
NEE_the_american_question_desc:0 "The question of what to do with our neighbors to the south is a difficult one. We wish to remain a part of the empire, a dominion in fact, but we cannot ignore the wonders and dangers alike that lay to the south. However, if we are committed to intervention, perhaps we could truly create a powerful Dominion of New England..."

Not to forget that it was a bloody waste of some good tea."
NEE_reorient_trade:0 "Reorient Trade"
NEE_reorient_trade_desc:0 "During the twenties and thirties, when the US economy was in chaos, our economy was mostly held up by trade with Canada.

NEE_import_tea:0 "Import Tea"
NEE_import_tea_desc:0 "Tea might be the most quintesentially British thing there is. Ever since the Canadian intervention, the product has become a rather popular commodity. What first began as a upper class fad has trickled down into the rest of society, and tea may now be the most popular drink in our populace. Better yet, India, the pearl of the empire, will provide us with however much tea we desire."
NEE_infrastructure_integration:0 "Infrastructure Integration"
NEE_infrastructure_integration_desc:0 "In terms of our roads, we are still very much seperate from our imperial bretheren. The US and Canada were always very serious about their border, and our ports aren't well equipped to handle the new pan-imperial trade. To further the efforts of integration, we must increase our connections with Canada and expand our ports to increase trade with Australasia and the Caribbean."

NEE_the_single_tax_desc:0 "The income tax, the excise tax, the estate tax, is their any end to what governments will take from hard-working citizens? There is only one tax that is just, the land value tax, for land is not created by anyone. Let us boot out the other taxes and enact the Vision of Henry George!"
NEE_nightwatchman_state:0 "Nightwatchman State"
NEE_nightwatchman_state_desc:0 "It is truly disgusting the extent governments attempt to control their citizens for the greater good while encouraging worse vices in the process. It's time to end the long list of arbitrary, moralizing laws against liquor, dancing, prostitution, drugs and other petty regulations for the good of liberty and to focus on fighting theft, fraud and aggression."
NEE_protect_liberty_from_democracy:0 "Defend Liberty from Democracy"
NEE_protect_liberty_from_democracy_desc:0 "We can not allow the populace to be cojouled into voting away their freedoms as so many other states have done! The Bill of Rights must see an expansion that covers economic freedoms related to property owning, trade and greater individual autonomy from government to prevent this, though some will call for us to go a step further."
NEE_decentralized_currency:0 "Decentralized Currency"
NEE_decentralized_currency_desc:0 "The centralization of currency under the federal government after the end of the Articles of Confederation lead to its logical conclusion in the tyrant Wilson created the Federal Reserve. No more! The States now have the right to create their own currency and trade amongst themselves while the Federal Dollar will merely be used to help maintain base neccesities related to military and law enforcement, and placed on a stricter gold standard to keep it in check."
NEE_state_militias:0 "State Militias"
NEE_state_militias_desc:0 "The Federal Government should maintain as small a military as possible as to defend our shores. However, a large military under the federal government could be tyrannical and thus instead we should have the bulk of our forces raised by state militias. They will keep the government in check, encourage civi virtue and their locality to what they're defending will make them harder defenders."
NEE_private_initative:0 "The Pursuit of Happiness"
NEE_private_initative_desc:0 "Government intervention in the economy has caused far more damage than good. Private initiative will pick up where government price distortions leave off, thus granting an opportunity for work and wealth to more private citizens. Likewise, the last remaining red tape shall be slashed, especially with regards to tariffs, arbitrary government standards and regulation of 'public' utilities."
NEE_end_public_schooling:0 "Nockian Education"
NEE_end_public_schooling_desc:0 "The public school system has been an abysmal failure, wasting children's time on pointless tasks and instilling them with federalist propaganda. Any schooling should be up each community that can focus on those with their needs or those with the greatest potential while higher education should be held to as high a standard as possible. No longer shall we finance public schooling."
NEE_jeffersonian_confederacy:0 "Jeffersonian Confederacy"
NEE_jeffersonian_confederacy_desc:0 "It is time to enshrine a real Constitution, one based on Jeffersonianism. The President will be a figurehead of the nation for times of war, Congress dealing with military defense and foreign policy and the vast majority of powers resting with the States, with the final federal economic laws overturned in the process and the state legislatures becoming more political empowered."
NEE_declaration_of_independence:0 "A Declaration of Independence"
NEE_declaration_of_independence_desc:0 "We did not fight off the socialists just to live under the Redcoats!

NEE_expand_the_organization:0 "Expand the Organization"
NEE_expand_the_organization_desc:0 "The Sentinels are the last defenders of real liberty in our republic, from threats both domestic and foreign! However, many uninformed citizens are still painfully unaware of this. We should spread the word as widely as possible through radio, pamphlets and even private relations for citizens to join the Sentinels and enjoy the benefits of doing so, especially those productive businessmen who should stand with us against statists."
NEE_private_defense_forces:0 "Private Defense Forces"
NEE_private_defense_forces_desc:0 "The state military system is a failure, being notable disloyal by accepting any government that takes power, a threat to liberty and soaking up absurd amounts of resources. Instead private defense contractors should take their place. While this will shrink the military it still leave the most qualified for fighting, and after corresponding tax cuts the Sentinel Organization will keep in the employ as many military men as it can afford, choosing quality over quantity. Those who desire protection can either pay us or go to another."
NEE_beyond_privatization:0 "Beyond Privatization"
NEE_beyond_privatization_desc:0 "We are not merely going to put an end to tariffs and public utilities as the Freemen propose. No, we will go a step further than that. Yes, the roads and current public goods will be privatized, but alongside them virtually all laws related to economic regulation will be struck down. It is time for the Invisible Hand to take precendence."
NEE_dissolving_the_state:0 "Dissolving the State"
NEE_dissolving_the_state_desc:0 "It is time. The court system, the remnants of public defense, the public police, taxes and the last regulations will be done away with, both at the Federal and state level. The largest monopoly in the land will finally be dismantled and instead man will finally be able to act out his will under true liberty."
NEE_might_makes_right:0 "Right of Might"
NEE_might_makes_right_desc:0 "The Sentinels must protect the new status quo at all costs! Of course, man has a right to either lose or take that land which can not be defended so let us defend it well. The Sentinels will take over lands bordering us that refuse to pay the appropriate protection fees and use it to further fund private defenses against foreign enemies."
NEE_crush_statists:0 "Crush Statists"
NEE_crush_statists_desc:0 "The enemies of liberty have not left us simply because the state is gone. No, our enemies amongst in the Democratic wards, 'liberal' Businessmen, Socialistic Unions and English loyalists are still amongst us. A campaign by the largest military force in the territory, the Sentinels, to strike their organizations and seize their assets, will be a boon to liberty."
NEE_right_of_contract:0 "Right of Contract"
NEE_right_of_contract_desc:0 "While the right to take by force is always on the table, it can be quite costly compared to signing a contract. The Right of Contract is an informal right that allows both ourselves and the people of the New England to settle their differences via signed agreement. While we obviously can not put this into law we can set an example by spreading and honoring our business deals as widely as possible."
NEE_a_fee_for_our_aid:0 "A Fee for our Aid"
NEE_a_fee_for_our_aid_desc:0 "The Canadians insist that we act as a bulwark against syndicalism. While the Syndicalists are considered a great evil we should not simply do their bidding for free. If they and others who are opposed to syndicalism want our aid they should pay for the privilege."
NEE_hostile_takeover:0 "Hostile Takeover"
NEE_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "Some wealthy families, notably the Astors, refuse to join the Sentinels or respect us. They believe Canada or their family guards give them the right to ignore us. If they will put forward their resources to defend the new liberty then we will take over their assets and put it to better use. May the better man win."
NEE_expanded_labor_pool:0 "New Labor Pools"
NEE_expanded_labor_pool_desc:0 "Too many citizens behave as if the old standards are still in place with regards to labor agreements. But with labor freed of government standards all who desire to work can, including most importantly the very young whom have a right to our labor contracts as soon as they are old enough to understand them and sign. We will set a fine example by providing work for these little ones."
NEE_lothrop_stoddard:0 "The Nordic League"
NEE_lothrop_stoddard_desc:0 "In a shocking turn of events, Lothrop Stoddard and his eugenicist Nordic Party have come to power in New England. Supporting a platform of racial segregation and eventually purification, they will work to ensure the very survival of civilization!"
NEE_block_foreign_hordes:0 "Block Foreign Hordes"
NEE_block_foreign_hordes_desc:0 "Our peril is clear: the other races are reproducing at a worrying rate, far faster than that of the Nordics. There is little we can do about this state of affairs, given our own measly power, but we do control our own territory. We must bar these inferior elements, and turn them away. Should we include our own countrymen, however?" 
NEE_racial_catalogues:0 "Racial Catalogues"
NEE_racial_catalogues_desc:0 "It is time for a different type of census. We will endeavor to create new racial classifications, established along the lines of Stoddard's previous works, that will divide our society from now on. This will allow for greater ease in purifying our nation at a later date. We also must decide the place of each of these groups, once we have decided how to categorize them."
NEE_embrace_science:0 "Embrace Science"
NEE_embrace_science_desc:0 "For too long, society has been ruled by passion, prejudice, and unreason. We must eliminate these illogical ideas and work towards the betterment of society through the promotion of science. In particular, we must advance the fields of Medicine, Psychology, and most of all, Biology. Through this effort, we can improve our methods of Eugenics, so that we may better our civilization."
NEE_help_the_kkk:0 "Help the Klan"
NEE_help_the_kkk_desc:0 "The Constitutional American Republic has been the main front for the Ku Klux Klan in the American Civil War. However, Stoddard believes the Klan could use some assistance from his own territory, not to mention their potential benefits for New England, and we should decide how we wish to aid them. They will surely be happy to return the favor..."
NEE_american_birth_control_league:0 "American Birth Control League"
NEE_american_birth_control_league_desc:0 "The A.B.C.L. is an institution that gives women the opportunity to control whether or not they have children, and such an organization is just what Lothrop Stoddard needs. We must make sure that only worthy mothers have children, and one child raised in a prosperous family will always be preferable to three children raised in poverty. Let us embrace this organization on a national level." 
NEE_neo_aristocracy:0 "The Neo-Aristocracy"
NEE_neo_aristocracy_desc:0 "New advances in the field of science have exposed democracy for the sham it is. Now, that institution is even more challenged than it was after the Weltkrieg, and meanwhile, aristocracy has been validated as the logical form of government. However, this does not mean arbitrary inequality-rather, we shall have natural rule by a class of superior men and women, and those with the talent to rise will have the ability to do so."
NEE_southern_purity:0 "Southern Purity"
NEE_southern_purity_desc:0 "The South is one of the few regions left in which the old American stock continues to grow. In New England, the Midwest, and elsewhere, immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe have diluted the population. We should emulate the South and promote a pure Anglo-Saxon populace, with some immigration from Northern and Western Europe to help bolster our numbers."
NEE_sterilize_the_masses:0 "Sterilize the Degenerate Masses"
NEE_sterilize_the_masses_desc:0 "The process of purification must be a gradual one, but the first step will be to sterilize the worst degenerates in the population-the unadaptable, the inferior, and the disabled. These elements will be segregated, miscegenation of any sort shall be banned, and we will use the advances in birth contol technology when necessary, all in the pursuit of purification." 
NEE_positive_eugenics:0 "Positive Eugenics"
NEE_positive_eugenics_desc:0 "Eugenics is not all about limiting populations; in fact, "Positive" eugenics shall entail the multiplication of superior classes. We must encourage reproduction among these groups with the same enthusiasm we take towards the sterilization of the inferior classes, for one cannot work without the other, and through our efforts, we will create a new progressive civilization!"
NEE_stomp_the_undermen:0 "Stomp the 'Undermen'"
NEE_stomp_the_undermen_desc:0 "The phenomenon known as "Syndicalism" is not new in any sense of the word. In fact, it is only a continuation of the historical revolt of the Under-Man. The Under-Man is he who denies the advances of science, he who resents natural superiority and acts to overthrow the natural order. These men have taken power in France and Britain, but we shall not allow them to prevail here! We must do everything in our power to crush these elements, for they are the enemy of civilization itself!"
NEE_war_against_chaos:0 "War Against Chaos"
NEE_war_against_chaos_desc:0 "We face a titanic struggle today. It is the struggle between the civilized world and those who would see us return to more primitive times. These Under-Men, unable to accept the loss of the moral or scientific high-ground, have increasingly resorted to force to get their way, and this is intolerable. We must take intelligent action against these degenerates by spreading the truth about the threat they pose."
NEE_hereditary_intellect:0 "Hereditary Intellect"
NEE_hereditary_intellect_desc:0 "Just as many forms of insanity have been proven to be hereditary, so too is intellect. If we allow the environment to take precedence over inherited capacity, we will be fostering a decline in our civilization! No, we must promote the idea of intellect through heredity, an idea first gifted to us by the Greeks and now proven by science. After all, you cannot make greatness out of mediocrity..."
NEE_selective_subsidies:0 "Selective Subsidies"
NEE_selective_subsidies_desc:0 "Birth rates in our Nordic elements have stagnated as of late. Though this may not be such a problem in an ideal society, it is a problem when the inferior classes reproduce so rapidly. By granting subsidies to the groups we want to reproduce and rewarding them for doing so, we can further the cause of Positive eugenics."
NEE_progressive_civilization:0 "Progressive Civilization"
NEE_progressive_civilization_desc:0 "We have taken the first steps towards a truly progressive civilization! It may be decades or even centuries before our true vision is reached, but we have begun the important work of separating the inferior from the superior, encouraging the multiplication of superior persons, and vanquishing the rebellious Under-Man, who has afflicted civilization since its very inception. Towards a shining future for our country!"
NEE_natural_inequality:0 "Natural Inequality"
NEE_natural_inequality_desc:0 "The flaws in democracy and aristocracy were their promotion of "natural equality" and "artifical inequality" respectively. Instead, we will promote a society in which merit determines your place, merit that is given to a person before they are ever born, determined by heredity. The superior man shall rise regardless of his place at birth, and the mediocre and degenerate classes will have their place as well until such a time as they are eliminated."

NEE_WASP:0 "Deploy the WASPs"
NEE_WASP_desc:0 "The birthplace of American feminism lies in Seneca, in upstate New York. We need to ensure that patriotic women can contribute to the war effort just as their male counterparts.

NEE_US_Navy:0 "New England's Navy"

NEE_Liberty_Ships_desc:0 "With war in Europe inevitable, and with the Entente's ambitions to execute the largest naval operation in the history of mankind, the dockyards of New England are working overtime to meet the increasing needs of the alliance. To further boost our output, a centralised construction scheme has been created by the government to guide further expansion of these shipyards."

NEE_destroyer_effort:0 "Destroyer Effort"

NEE_submarine_effort:0 "Salmon Class Submarines"
NEE_submarine_effort_desc:0 "An incremental improvement over the previous Porpoise class, they will be the first American submarine class to achieve 21 knots with a reliable propulsion plant, allowing them to operate with the Standard-type battleships of the surface fleet. Their range of over 11.000 Nautical miles also further makes them the prime submarine in operations from the Atlantic to the Pacific."

NEE_US_Airforce:0 "New England Air Force"
NEE_US_Airforce_desc:0 "Although we have little experience with the use of aircraft in military operations, the Weltkrieg has shown its crucial role on the battlefield and years of continued research and development in the field has led to the creation of our own air force. Although untested in battle, our manufacturers have guaranteed us that America has and will always have the best aircraft in the world."

NEE_Air_Defence_Command:0 "Establish Air Defence Command"

NEE_ISAC_Equipement:0 "ISAC Equipment Reliance"
NEE_ISAC_Equipement_desc:0 "The Canadian ISAC initiative has established itself as a veritable authority in the field of armament research and its production capacity and technological knowhow still leave us far behind.

NEE_Self_Reliance:0 "Self-Reliance"
NEE_Self_Reliance_desc:0 "We are an American nation, not some Canadian puppet, and allowing ourselves to become too complacent in arms development by benefitting from Canadian expertise will become a problem should we one day be forced into combat with the rest of America and find ourselves technologically behind our northern allies."

NEE_Infrastructure_Act:0 "Pass the Infrastructure Act"

NEE_bureau_of_industry:0 "Bureau of Central Planning"
NEE_bureau_of_industry_desc:0 "Public works programs are a good way of ensuring that unemployment does not breed radicalism.

NEE_Settlement_Movement:0 "Settlement Movement"
NEE_Settlement_Movement_desc:0 "The Settlement Movement of the 1920s tried to bring the rich and poor of society together in both physical and social proximity. Its main object was the establishment of 'settlement houses' in poor urban areas, in which volunteer middle-class 'settlement workers' would live, hoping to share knowledge and culture with, and alleviate the poverty of, their low-income neighbors. We must bring back this program!"

NEE_appoint_chaffee:0 "Father Chaffee"
NEE_appoint_chaffee_desc:0 "Adna R. Chaffee has been an avid horseman his whole life. Now, however, he urges us to embrace the future. Chaffee is specifically concerned with tanks.

NEE_mechanical_cavalry:0 "Mechanical Cavalry"
NEE_mechanical_cavalry_desc:0 "Real wars are fought by real men, not solely by tanks. However, we can still use technology to serve these men.

NEE_coordination_principal:0 "The Coordination Principle"
NEE_coordination_principal_desc:0 "As the foremost power in the world, Germany's military should be something to emulate.

This will greatly aid our inter-branch cooperation and experience."
NEE_experimental_organization:0 "Experimental Divisions"
NEE_experimental_organization_desc:0 "Father Chaffee has relentlessly pressed us to not only modernize our vehicles, but to experiment with new ones.

NEE_research_grants_desc:0 "Our breakthroughs in tanks and mobile warfare have inspired our scientists and engineers to push for even more research in those areas, and we now believe that we will have an edge on our opponents in these areas. Such a focus may detract from other technological fronts, but Father Chaffee reassures us that we are doing what we need to to win."
NEE_industrial_grants:0 "Industrial Grants"
NEE_industrial_grants_desc:0 "Let us continue our effort to become a North American industrial giant. Specifically, we should focus on military factories that can produce more equipment for our war effort. After all, Chaffee's doctrine is impossible without reinforcements."

NEE_general_pershing:0 "General Pershing"
NEE_general_pershing_desc:0 "John J. Pershing has been one of America's foremost generals for decades. A staunch supporter of New English autonomy within the Entente, he has his own plan for our military. Though some say he is outdated in his approach, Pershing insists that planning is the key aspect of warfare. He has learned from his observations of the Weltkrieg, and will make sure we outthink our enemies."
NEE_infantry_investments:0 "Infantry Research Developments"
NEE_infantry_investments_desc:0 "Some of our officials want us to focus on tanks or artillery. Pershing disagrees. He is quick to point out that in his day, infantry were the driving force behind armies, and he believes they still are. To that end, he has encouraged us to invest in new infantry technology, so each and every one of our soldiers can have an edge over his foe. Pershing is confident that his old tactics can still rout any enemy we face." 
NEE_streamlined_staff:0 "Streamlined Staff"
NEE_streamlined_staff_desc:0 "General Pershing has been given a new rank in our army, as a result of his loyalty and his experience. His new "General of the Armies" rank gives him complete control over our military. He believes that we must re-organize our military in a way that allows them to be more efficient and coordinate quicker. With these things, we can outfox the enemy."
NEE_open_warfare:0 "Open Warfare"
NEE_open_warfare_desc:0 "America is a great expanse, and battles fought on her soil will be different than those fought in Europe. We must be ready for open warfare. Pershing has suggested we follow the Schlieffen model of a quick encirclement of our enemies. Though it may have failed in the Weltkrieg, he believes we have the necessary technology to make that sort of plan a success today."
NEE_natural_defenses:0 "Natural Defenses"
NEE_natural_defenses_desc:0 "New England is a place of varied geography. The Hudson River and the Catskills mountains on our southern border can serve as a natural defense against any who dare cross our border. Pershing has incorporated these natural features into his grand plan, and believes they will not hinder our military, and in fact do just the opposite."
NEE_breakthrough_emphasis:0 "Breakthrough Emphasis"
NEE_breakthrough_emphasis_desc:0 "As a man who has been a senior officer in the military long enough to see the Weltkrieg come and go, General Pershing believes breakthroughs are a crucial part of warfare. His plan, like the German plans all those years ago, does not take enemy defenses into account. But, unlike them, Pershing says we have the technology to get around anything they can throw at us."
NEE_long_range_logistics:0 "Long-Range Logistics"
NEE_long_range_logistics_desc:0 "To win any modern war, we must be prepared for large fronts. With tanks and planes, we can help our army push deep into enemy lines.

NEE_expand_westpoint:0 "Expand Westpoint"
NEE_expand_westpoint_desc:0 "General Pershing graduated from Westpoint over 50 years ago. Despite this, he has never lost his belief in the institution as a necessity for any aspiring officer.

NEE_american_marksmenship:0 "American Marksmenship"
NEE_american_marksmenship_desc:0 "A well-trained army has scouts, and a well-trained modern army has snipers. It also has soldiers who rarely miss.

NEE_iron_discipline:0 "Iron Discipline"
NEE_iron_discipline_desc:0 "Though we may not have the manpower or the industrial capacity of our rivals, we have something they can not match. One advantage Pershing insists we have is in the mental state of our men. The discipline of our soldiers will be unmatched, and they will neither break nor surrender. With an unbreakable will and iron discipline, New England will never be beaten."
NEE_merit_promotion:0 "Promotion by Merit"
NEE_merit_promotion_desc:0 "An effective military should always issue promotions based on merit, not bloodline. Such a tradition is deeply American, and is also practiced by the mightiest army on Earth. By emphasizing that anyone with talent can ascend the ranks, we will encourage our brightest and sharpest minds to join our military and serve New England."
NEE_black_combat_troops:0 "Black Combat Training"
NEE_black_combat_troops_desc:0 "Pershing is in favor of a "separate-but-equal" approach to Black soldiers. He has encouraged the creation of all-black units and insists that their training is indeed equal to that of any other soldier. This will encourage Black soldiers from our rivals to flee here, he notes, because they will have more control within their own units. Whether he is right or not is yet to be seen."
NEE_assault_the_line:0 "Assault the Line"
NEE_assault_the_line_desc:0 "Trench Warfare is still relevant today, as it was in the Weltkrieg. Unlike those poor souls, our soliders will not lose their lives fighting for mere feet or even inches of land. Instead, we will make sure we can break any line we face. Pershing insists we show the Europeans (and our rivals) that we are superior to them in this way."

NEE_old_gravel_voice_desc:0 "Ernest N. Harmon is one of our top generals, and he has a distinct plan.

With a focus on these things, Old Gravel Voice knows that we will blow our enemies to smithereens."
NEE_integrated_armor:0 "Integrated Armor"
NEE_integrated_armor_desc:0 "Tanks are fairly new to warfare, but have similar explosive potential to artillery. Put together, the forces can bring hellfire on our enemy.

NEE_decisive_tactics:0 "Tactical Decisiveness"
NEE_decisive_tactics_desc:0 "If there is any lesson that should be learned from the Weltkrieg, it is that the enemy should be destroyed decisively before they have a chance to dig in. To avoid prolonged conflicts, we will invest in aggressive and decisive tactics that allow us to use our superior firepower to our advantage."
NEE_artillery_line:0 "Artillery Offensive"
NEE_artillery_line_desc:0 "Harmon argues that an investment in artillery would go a long way in breaking through to the south, or in any other theater of war. With artillery coming first, the enemy line will be like melted butter, and our infantry will be the knife that slices through it."
NEE_counter_attack:0 "Counter-Attack Bias"
NEE_counter_attack_desc:0 "General Hermon believes that if our men are being pushed back, they should fire with overwhelming artillery force to hold the line and even push the enemy back. In fact, Harmon prefers this strategy, noting it allows the enemy to fall into our artillery's waiting jaws."

NEE_armored_spearhead_desc:0 "Though he emphasizes use of artillery and airplanes, Hermon is also a strong proponent of armored warfare. He believes that our tanks can punch holes in enemy lines that can be followed up on by planes, artillery, and infantry, in order to overwhelm our enemy. Let us train our men and build our equipment to serve this purpose."
NEE_mechanical_drawing:0 "Westpoint Engineering"
NEE_mechanical_drawing_desc:0 "Westpoint is one of the greatest military institutions in the world, but officers are not the only graduates. There are also engineers with crucial knowledge that could bolster our war effort. Giving more funding to Westpoint and encouraging engineering as a career will help our military overcome some of the greatest annoyances we can encounter in war."
NEE_bombing_support:0 "Bombing Support"
NEE_bombing_support_desc:0 "We shall bomb our enemy into submission until they praise the lord. Airplanes can carry heavier loads than ever before, and Old Gravel Voice insists we use this fact to our advantage. Let us fill the sky with planes and make sure that the enemy is soft for our ground forces."
NEE_firepower_purchase:0 "Heavy Equipment Purchase"
NEE_firepower_purchase_desc:0 "We will purchase tanks, artillery, motorized vehicles, and other equipment such as bullets to make sure our men are never out of ammo. With this effort, we can win against our more numerous rivals, as we will have many bullets for every soldier they can throw our way. Every soldier shall shout "pass the ammunition!" and we will fire until the enemy is eviscerated."

NEE_green_policy:0 "Green Policy"
NEE_green_policy_desc:0 "Theodore F. Green may not be a general, but he is one of our foremost politicians. A committed internationalist, he wishes to see New England take its rightful place on the world stage. To do that, Green knows we need a large army, to compete with our rivals. He has pushed legislation ramping up conscription to begin this effort."
NEE_consistant_conscription:0 "Consistent Conscription"
NEE_consistant_conscription_desc:0 "Green's bill has passed, and we are now conscripting our young men to build a larger army than ever before. None of our rivals will outnumber us. With such a force, we can project power up and down the East Coast and perhaps across the Atlantic, should we decide to help the Entente retake Europe."
NEE_moral_idealism:0 "Moral Idealism"
NEE_moral_idealism_desc:0 "We will fight the good fight, the right fight.

NEE_yankee_nationalism:0 "Yankee Patriotism"
NEE_yankee_nationalism_desc:0 "We are Yankees, and we are proud of it. Reactionaries to the south use this term in a derogatory meaning, but to New Englanders, it is part of our identity. Though we now fight with our old rulers, we will never forget we became in the meantime."
NEE_farmer_soldiers:0 "Farmers into Soldiers"
NEE_farmer_soldiers_desc:0 "Farmers should not be exempt from the draft. They are some of our strongest citizens, and could serve us well in the military. Besides, we could use all the men we can get, or so Green says. This will certainly provide us with more manpower, but it may have negative effects on our population's ability to eat."
NEE_silver_military_lease:0 "Silver Lease"
NEE_silver_military_lease_desc:0 "Let us release silver that the government owns, in order to help serve our war effort. Now that we have manpower in our military, Green wants us to also ramp up miiltary spending quite a bit, to pay for all the new equipment we will need. We have grudgingly done this, with the understanding that all this money will be put to good use."
NEE_mass_spending:0 "Mass Spending"
NEE_mass_spending_desc:0 "Green has seen our willingness to give him increased military spending, and he has run with it. He now makes impassioned speeches calling for a great increase in military spending, so that we can have the largest military in all of North America. While his goal may be outlandish for now, we cannot deny that he has a sort of point. Let us increase the spending once again."

### Setting up New England ###

newengland.1.t:0 "The Occupation of New England"
newengland.1.d:0 "The outbreak of civil war in America has left the New England region only lightly-defended and vulnerable to occupation. If we strike quickly and seize the region, we could close a weak point on our eastern flank and strengthen our position against any invasion from a hostile southern power. All but abandoned by their government, we anticipate our New England cousins will welcome our intervention."
newengland.1.a:0 "Seize New England!"
newengland.1.b:0 "It is too risky"

newengland.2.t:0 "Canada Moves Into New England"
newengland.2.d:0 "The New England region has been beset by syndicalist militia violence, to the point that the governors in the region - worried at the prospect of being overrun by [CSA.GetNameDef] and unwilling to wait for the Federal government to restore order - have requested that [CAN.GetNameDef] intervene with its forces to restore order. The Canadian government has sent us notification of their intent, and has stressed that they only wish to safeguard the lives of innocents and that they will discuss the matter further with the American government once peace has been restored. While some in the [Root.GetAdjective] cabinet feel the Canadians have violated our sovereignty, there is little we can do about it at the moment."

newengland.2.a:0 "To War"
newengland.2.b:0 "We will Deal with this later!"

newengland.3.t:0 "Terror in New England"
newengland.3.d:0 "New England has been besieged by syndicalist militia violence, and the governors in the region are terrified that the Federal government won't be able to prevent a rapid takeover of the entire region. Apparently they went so far as to formally request an intervention by [CAN.GetNameDef], but the Canadian government has declined to get involved... at least as of yet. As a result, militia groups in Boston are rapidly mobilizing to try and organize a proper defence of the area."
newengland.3.a:0 "We'll help as much as we're able"

newengland.5.t:0 "The Question of New England"
newengland.5.d:0 "Now that we have intervened in New England, a number of Canadian ministers have met with leaders from those states regarding how best to keep order. The states have suggested setting up a provisional government for the region, one that would - at least initially - be under our control and brought into the Entente alliance. Some members of the government, however, have suggested it would be better if we simply occupied and adminstered the territory ourselves. Americans, they say, can sometimes be of suspect loyalty - grateful or not, their goals may not mirror our own."
newengland.5.a:0 "Set up the provisional government"
newengland.5.b:0 "Set up the provisional government (play as New England)"
newengland.5.c:0 "Continue with the military occupation"

newengland.6.t:0 "The Provisional government of New England"
newengland.6.d:0 "Thanks to our allies in Canada, we have set up a provisional government in Boston as we prepare to liberate the rest of our country. Unfortunately, not many people both in and out of the states in New England believe that we are the true and legitimate America, and we must rectify this problem"
newengland.6.a:0 "Don't tread on me!"

newengland.7.t:0 "America is Reunited"
newengland.7.d:0 "At long last America has been reunited. We stretch once again from sea to shining sea. The traitors to the country have been destroyed and the stars and stripes now fly proudly from coast to coast knowing that liberty is secured for all."

## Focus Tree Events ###

newengland.10.t:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
newengland.10.d:0 "A bill has come before to help improve the conditions of the workers within America.

newengland.10.a:0 "Pass the Act."
newengland.10.b:0 "Do Not Pass the Act."

newengland.11.t:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
newengland.11.d:0 "A bill has come before to help improve the conditions of the economy and workplace. The so-called Labor-Relations Act is obviously designed to help the businesses over the workers. And thus, it is facing push-back from the more liberal members of Congress that believe it does not go far enough. So, the question is will congress pass the bill or not."
newengland.11.a:0 "Pass the Act."
newengland.11.b:0 "Do not Pass the Act."

newengland.12.t:0 "New England Demands Home Rule"
newengland.12.d:0 "The New England provisional government, now that it has established its military and structure, has demanded that it be granted home rule. Some members of the Canadian government are taken aback by the tone of the demand, seeing as the Canadian government is what enabled New Englanders to avoid the chaos rampant in the rest of America, though others (perhaps rightly) point out that unless Canada's ambition is to govern Americans as colonial subjects there is no reason not to give New England what it seeks."
newengland.12.a:0 "Grant them home rule."
newengland.12.b:0 "No, they are too valuable."

newengland.13.t:0 "Canada Agrees"
newengland.13.d:0 "The Canadian government has responded to our demand in the affirmative. They are ready to relinquish all control over our government apparatus, and have expressed williness to work with us as equal partners in the Entente alliance."
newengland.13.a:0 "We are grateful."

newengland.14.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
newengland.14.d:0 "Perhaps deciding that we are too valuable an asset in their quest to retake the Home Isles, or perhaps secretly coveting New England's territory as their own, the Canadian government has refused to grant New England home rule. We are, at least for the foreseeable future, their subject...something which has provided a serious blow to our government's legitimacy."
newengland.14.a:0 "This is an outrage!"

newengland.15.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declares Independence"
newengland.15.d:0 "Chafing ever since we refused them home rule, the New England government has finally declared its independence, abandoning our alliance entirely."

newengland.15.b:0 "No, this cannot be allowed!"

newengland.124.t:0 "New England's Foreign Policy?"
newengland.124.d:0 "Our young nation must now create a foreign policy for itself. Two main schools of thought have presented themselves. One says we move closer to our allies in the North, and help the Entente. The other promotes a more neutral approach to foreign policy that will see us govern ourselves."`

### Flavor Events ####

newengland.40.t:0 "The Great New England Hurricane of 1938"
newengland.40.d:0 "What was first considered a non-issue, the Yankee Clipper Hurricane arrived on Long Island September 21st and would only a few hours later turn out to be largest Hurricane to set foot in New England since the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.\n\nMoving North from Long Island to Connecticut, Rhode Island and up through Vermont the storm cost the lives of close to 700 people. By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."
newengland.40.a:0 "God save us all."

newengland.41.t:0 "Road integration with Canada?"
newengland.41.d:0 "As we continue building up our economy and expanding the road network, the question arose of which direction we should drive on. While the custom in America has always been to drive on the right Canada has, since the British revolution in 1925, driven on the left.\n\nSome political leaders have suggested that we switch to driving on the Left in an attempt to better integrate our road network into the Canadian one whilst others of course wish to stay driving on the right to further amplify that New England is not a British Dominion."
newengland.41.a:0 "We shall adapt to the British model."
newengland.41.b:0 "American cars drive on the side of Freedom!"

### Underground Railroad ###
newengland.50.t:0 "The Underground Railroad"
newengland.50.d:0 "Established in the 1700s, the first Underground Railroad served as a network of secret routes with as purpose to clandestinely transport Afro-American slaves from the Thirteen Colonies into Canada where slavery was already abolished.\n\nWith the American Civil War tearing apart households across the Americans and ideological strive leading to the forced expulsion or sometimes even massacre of Americans, our government has reignited the old "Railroad" and has with the aid of locals on both sides of the border re-established the network with the hopes of safely transporting refugees to our little nation."
newengland.50.a:0 "There is only so much we can do though..."

#CSA
newengland.51.t:0 "The Lake Erie Migration Crisis"
newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as opposing forces fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."
newengland.51.a:0 "Allow covert operatives to establish a base on Pelee Island."
newengland.51.b:0 "We can not put the lives of innocents in danger with our schemes!"

newengland.52.t:0 "Successful Smuggling Operation on Lake Erie"
newengland.52.d:0 "Tucked away beneath sheets of linen and between the clothes of refugees, our covert operatives on the far side of Lake Erie have been able to successfully smuggle small arms, munition, medical supplies. Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the carcass"

newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers apprehended!"
newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carabines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."
newengland.53.a:0 "Change the course of the routes, we can not stop the operation!"
newengland.53.b:0 "It's too risky, we should focus on the refugee program."

newengland.54.t:0 ""Jack" the Doberman"
newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop militia agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the agents who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."
newengland.54.a:0 "We express our thanks to this good boy!"

newengland.55.t:0 "Refugees from the CSA"
newengland.55.d:0 "The horrors of war keep raging in [CSA.GetNameDef] and the large migratory wave from theirs into our territory seems to know no end. Just as last month, the Underground Railroad has once again led to the successful transfer of thousands of these war refugees into our Safe Harbour."
newengland.55.a:0 "Let us pray the violence will end soon."

#TEX
newengland.56.t:0 "Refugees from the AUS"
newengland.56.d:0 "Although the journey is full of peril and even though bandits and/or criminals stalk the trails from the deep South all the way to Connecticut, thousands still depart on the journey hoping that they may find peace and a protector in our nation."
newengland.56.a:0 "Welcome to New England!"

newengland.57.t:0 "Pelley asserts control in the AUS"
newengland.57.d:0 "It came as no surprise to the people of America that Huey Long served only as a tool for the far more dangerous Pelley. Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."
newengland.57.a:0 "We have no place for them either!"
newengland.57.b:0 "Install strict refugee quotas and only allow a select few in."
newengland.57.c:0 "In Boston one is not discriminated for the colour of his skin!"

newengland.58.t:0 "Unchecked Migration"
newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organizations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organizations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realizing that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."
newengland.58.a:0 "Close the Border!"
newengland.58.b:0 "We are the only hope these people have, let them in!"

newengland.59.t:0 "Appointing the New England Poet Laureate"
newengland.59.d:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The top candidate in the congressional poll is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. Public polls, however, has shown favour for the pulp fiction writer H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft has written in the papers that he would accept this award, but not appear in public for the ceremony. The Library of Congress is in a bind."
newengland.59.a:0 "Robert Frost, Modernist Master."
newengland.59.b:0 "H.P Lovecraft, the Master of Horror."

newengland.60.t:0 "Intervention for John Winant"
newengland.60.d:0 "The private life of President Winant is not the proper subject of newspaper gossip, but after today, it is a public issue. President Winant's minders found a loaded gun in his bedroom tonight, and after a panic determined their was no intended assassin. President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter. Fortunately, Winston Churchill was very gently notified, and forgave President Winant in person. Winant has decided to take a few days break to recuperate mentally."
newengland.60.a:0 "He just need a few days off."

newengland.61.t:0 "Gerry Campaigns for Mackenzie King"
newengland.61.d:0 "Long before his career in politics, Peter Gerry was a student at Harvard. There, he was tutored by Canadian Deputy Minister of Labor William Lyon King. These lessons had a major impact on Gerry. Now, King is a major Liberal politician whose allies stateside are the Republicans and the Liberals. As a President, Gerry has talked with his advisers about crossing the party line to help his old mentor. This would invariably debase the Democrats, and aid the Liberals in America. "
newengland.61.a:0 "Don't cross party lines!"
newengland.61.b:0 "Gerry can campaign as he pleases."

newengland.62.t:0 "Cocoanut Grove fire traced back to Tobin"
newengland.62.d:0 "A massive fire erupted in the popular Boston nightclub, Cocoanut Grove, leaving almost 500 people dead. Among the victims are several high ranking American immigrants, and the uproar searching for an answer has raced the highest halls of power. It appears that several mid-level Democratic party politicians had taken bribes earlier this month before an inspection. This inspection was independently determined to be insufficient, and the public prosecutor is preparing a case aledging massive conspiracy. This has rocked public support for Democrats across New England."
newengland.62.a:0 "A shame upon the city."

newengland.63.t:0 "Rockefeller Center artifacts recovered, some defaced"
newengland.63.d:0 "Since the abandoning of New York City to the militant unions, Nelson has sought to recover whatever he can from his prized Rockefeller Center. It appears now, that most of the artwork installed in the skyscraper is now for sale, which Nelson took advantage of. When these relics of a peaceful America arrived, we were all ashamed to find them defaced. It appears Diego Rivera, whose murals were rejected for installation, took it upon himself to replace images of Zeus with Marx. Among several other mythological heroes were all strategically replaced with their respective socialist myth-men. These priceless works of art are ruined."
newengland.63.a:0 "I'll get you Rivera, someday!"

newengland.64.t:0 "Canadians apply for West Point"
newengland.64.d:0 "The Class of 1944 has just arrived, and their numbers are far below expectations. As it is still necessary for Senators to recommend prospective young men, the decrease from 100 new cadets to just 14. It has been suggested that we allow Canadian politicians to recommend their young men to West Point. We are in dire need of new officers, and yet at the same time, this time honored tradition ensures that this institution isn't used by foreign powers, much less the Crown."
newengland.64.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
newengland.64.b:0 "We do need the people."

### Freedom Fliers ###
newengland.70.t:0 "Choosing our Propaganda"
newengland.70.d:0 "The "Freedom Fliers" initiative has been activated by our government but there is still much discussion about the content of the dropped messages as the right message could wreak havoc behind their lines but the wrong message could further bolster their resolve.\n\nWhether to strike the civilian population or the armed forces directly also remains a topic for debate as some have argued that the enemy homefront would be more susceptible to our message but a direct strike on their armed forces could lead to a more direct effect."
newengland.70.a:0 "Attempt to disrupt their attack plans with wrong information."
newengland.70.b:0 "Trick their troops in leaving gaps in their defences."
newengland.70.c:0 "Spread uncertainty on their Home Front."
newengland.70.e:0 "Try to demoralise their troops."

newengland.71.t:0 "The Tale of Private Bob 'Daredevil' Rogers"
newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above enemy territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by an anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering enemy supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathizers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob traveled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the enemy agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."
newengland.71.a:0 "The American nation thanks her son for his service!"

newengland.72.t:0 "Further Expansion of the 'Freedom Fliers'"
newengland.72.d:0 "Recent successes with the Corps have prompted many to question whether the planes should also be used to perform air drops behind enemy lines to supply the resistance cells with weapons and further equipment. Some have argued however that this deviates too far from the original peaceful mission of the Freedom Fliers and that the extra equipment and manpower necessary for the operations might very well be better spend elsewhere."
newengland.72.a:0 "Assign them the resources!"
newengland.72.b:0 "It's too risky."

newengland.73.t:0 "Sabotage on the Bedford Army Air Field"
newengland.73.d:0 "Under cover of darkness and with support from within, foreign operatives have succeeded in causing massive damage to the fighter planes stationed in Bedford. Dozens of planes have been lost or damaged and the hangars have suffered from various small explosions. We have thus far been unable to stop them and there isn't even an answer as to which faction the saboteurs adhere."
newengland.73.a:0 "Are we blind? Deploy the Garrison!"

newengland.80.t:0 "The Yankee Rebellion"
newengland.80.d:0 "While our intention upon occupying New England was to safeguard the locals from the ravages of the American Civil War, it seems many of them have taken exception. Several leaders in Boston have publicly accused Canada of desiring solely to return the area to British rule, to squeeze whatever we can out of the region so that we can return to the Home Isles, and that they would have been better off throwing their lot in with their American brothers and sisters. The fever pitch in the area has reached the point where we may have to reconsider our plan for New England self-government... or face a long period of uprisings."
newengland.80.a:0 "This will amount to nothing."
newengland.80.b:0 "Bah, very well - set up the provisional government."

newengland.85.t:0 "Yankee Rebellion Over"
newengland.85.d:0 "It has taken many months, but it appears the so-called Yankee Rebellion in New England is over. Resistance leaders have either been captured or fled, and the remaining local governments all seem to be on board with the Canadian government - spurred on, one imagines, by the pictures of devastation throughout the rest of America playing across their newspaper pages. We should see no further trouble in the area."
newengland.85.a:0 "Finally!"

newengland.90.t:0 "Rejoining America"
newengland.90.d.forced:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs. There was little time to discuss the matter in Boston, however, as almost instantly a public campaign swept across the country demanding we dissolve the government at once. New England, the public feels, is not a real country - and its government does not have sufficient legitimacy to refuse the [From.GetAdjective] request."
newengland.90.d.choice:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs, now that the civil war is over and the victor decided. There are many who feel that the main purpose of New England's provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - has been served, and we should become part of America once again. There are others, however, who feel that New England has achieved its own sense of legitimacy. We have a place in the British sphere, and is being a part of [From.GetNameDef] what we truly want? Are they truly the America we remember?"
newengland.90.a:0 "It seems we have no choice but to agree..."
newengland.90.b:0 "We should rejoin America."
newengland.90.c:0 "No, this is not in our best interests."

newengland.91.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Request"
newengland.91.d:0 "The ambassador from [From.GetNameDef] has met with [Root.GetAdjective] officials and presented their plan: they wish to peacefully reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], effective immediately. Now that the civil war is done, they believe the purpose of New England's provisional government - namely to avoid the chaos and destruction - is also passed. America, they say, must be one once more. There is a mixed reaction within the government, though most agree that [requester.GetNameDef] will not sit idly by should we refuse."
newengland.91.a:0 "Then we wish them well."
newengland.91.b:0 "We agree, if [requester.GetNameDef] joins the Entente."
newengland.91.c:0 "No, we cannot permit that."

newengland.92.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.92.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed that the provisional government's purpose is done. They hold no claim over the New England region and wish no conflict with [requester.GetNameDef], nor intend to make any demands upon them for New England's return. [From.GetAdjective] forces have begun to leave the area immediately."
newengland.92.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

newengland.93.t:0 "Reunion with New England"
newengland.93.d:0 "Officials from New England delivered the message promptly: they will gladly unite with [Root.GetNameDef] at once. The purpose of their provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - is now over with, and they look forward to America being whole once again."
newengland.93.a:0 "Excellent!"

newengland.94.t:0 "The Canadian Concern"
newengland.94.d:0 "While the New England government is not a Canadian puppet, it would be false to suggest that it wasn't part of the British Empire - such as it is - and of great concern to the larger Canadian sphere of interest. The Canadian government is willing to allow New England to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], since the reason for Canada's intervention in the region ended with the civil war, but they are asking that [requester.GetNameDef] join the Entente alliance. This would make up for New England's loss, and also be a way to pay back [CAN.GetNameDef] for saving American lives."
newengland.94.a:0 "We'll see where this goes..."
newengland.94.b:0 "We're fine with that request."
newengland.94.c:0 "No, they have no right to make that demand."

newengland.95.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.95.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned with agreement - they will join the Entente in exchange for a peaceful reunion with New England, and as a way to pay back [Root.GetNameDef] for safeguarding so many American lives during the civil war."
newengland.95.a:0 "Might amenable of them!"

newengland.96.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.96.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned to Canada with a flat refusal - they will not bargain for New England's return, particularly since [CAN.GetNameDef] had no right to intervene in the civil war in the first place. The officials say that Canada took control of New England to safeguard themselves against radical forces, nothing more. With that threat gone, America should once again be whole."
newengland.96.a:0 "I wish mommy and daddy would stop fighting..."
newengland.96.b:0 "Very well, let them go."
newengland.96.c:0 "Then we refuse."

newengland.97.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.97.d.forced:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham. Since the New England lacks sufficient legitimacy to act as anything but a Canadian puppet, it has dissolved in a spasm of in-fighting and fury against the Canadians."
newengland.97.d.choice:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham: they intervened to safeguard British interests, nothing more. Now the New England government must decide for itself where its interests lie, and perhaps spark a war either way."
newengland.97.a:0 "So be it!"
newengland.97.b:0 "We will join [requester.GetNameDef] anyhow!"
newengland.97.c:0 "We remain with [From.GetNameDef]"

newengland.98.t:0 "New England Dissolves"
newengland.98.d:0 "With our refusal to allow New England to rejoin [requester.GetNameDef], their government has utterly dissolved due to internal conflict and a sense of it having no true legitimacy. The region is once again under our control, and very possibly may lead us into a war with [requester.GetNameDef]."
newengland.98.a:0 "So be it!"

newengland.99.t:0 "[war_country.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.99.d.exists:0 "For reasons not well understood, the New England government has decided that its best interests are served remaining a part of the British sphere. Many within our government are enraged, and wonder if New England's citizens feel the same as its government... or, perhaps it is better to say, the British?"
newengland.99.d.notexists:0 "While it appears New Englanders were more than willing to join with us peacefully, the Canadian intervention has exposed their provisional government for what it was: a puppet, subject to the will of the British crown. With their refusal to allow New England to choose its own destiny, the New England government has collapsed and been re-absorbed into [CAN.GetNameDef]."
newengland.99.a:0 "Then it's war!"
newengland.99.b:0 "We'll deal with this later."

newengland.100.t:0 "New England's Betrayal"
newengland.100.d:0 "While our government had refused New England's right to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], it seems they eventually decided to do so anyhow. Our forces in the region have pulled out as American forces moved in, and there appears to be nothing we can do - unless we choose to force the issue and make this a matter of war."
newengland.100.a:0 "Then it's war!"
newengland.100.b:0 "Let them have it."

newengland.101.t:0 "Syndicalist Revolts Increase!"
newengland.101.d:0 "While with Canadian backing we have managed to re-establish some order in the region syndicalist strikers are nonetheless extremely active in Massachusetts and militants are receiving support from the Combined Syndicates of America, with Leonard Abbott apparently organizing revolts against us from New York City, with rumors he plans to call on the workers to rise up at once and join the CSA. With the IWW and Socialist Parties still causing problems it is clear we are not out of the woods yet, and governor [NEE.GetLeader] has declared that anyone who attempts to overthrow the government and establish a 'syndicalist tyranny' will face the full force of the law."
newengland.101.a:0 "We will be ready"

newengland.102.t:0 "Radical Coalition formalizes!"
newengland.102.d:0 "The so-called Radical Coalition has cemented its political alliance in reaction to both Canadian and syndicalist influence in New England. This occurred after members of the two leading factions of the movement, "The Remnant" and "The Sentinels of the Republic", met and agreed to pool together their formally fairly weak militias. A loose grouping within New England lead by right-wing intellectuals and organizations, the Coalition is unified in viewing the State as the ultimate threat to man and the syndicalists as merely another group of fanatics attempting to use it for their own agenda of abolishing property laws. With the increase in populist movements in recent years, more middle and upper class citizens have listened to this faction of New England politics as both a counter-revolutionary force and a solution to the problem of politics. Albert Jay Nock is leader of the Remnant and the Freemen magazine, and the more radical wing of the Coalition, the Sentinels of the Republic, started as a right-wing lobbying group fighting virtually all forms of government intervention in the economy before going through a series of internal radicalizations. This involved influence from the Remnant and New England Right before turning to a mixture of Social Darwinist sciences and reinterpretations of Egoism to use their arguments against not only wealth redistribution but any attacks on the wealthy. This is something the original Egoists, whose arguments they borrowed, have mixed or even negative feelings about. \n\n With the formalization of the alliance, their supporters in Congress have officially changed their party affiliation to the Radical Coalition, with the Sentinels providing the funding and the Remnant the militia volunteers. Together they declare man's freedoms will not end so long as they are on watch."
newengland.102.a:0 "Extremists!"

newengland.103.t:0 "The Great Strike!"
newengland.103.d:0 "Using the semi-legal SPA's machine, Abbott has directed the New England workers to choose today to do a mass strike and have the militias rise at the same time, calling it the "two-pronged strategy"! Red Guards are overtaking South Boston and have some of our dockyards are suffering from mass strikes. We will need to act at once! We must either send our own men to try to overtake the militias which will be bloody but likely end in a victory, request Canadian assistance at the cost of likely becoming more reliant on Canada, something that is sure to anger many New Englanders but might end in a more favorable resolution. However some of our advisors believe to give Canada an opening to occupy our soil would open the gates to other extremist movements and believe we should just stomp it out ourselves."
newengland.103.a:0 "We can handle this!"
newengland.103.b:0 "Request Canada's aid!"

#Federalist Party Path#

newengland.104.t:0 "Canada Crushes the Rebellion!"
newengland.104.d:0 "Canadian Troops have stormed South Boston and swiftly ended the rebellion, leaving over 50 dead and the city pacified. The dockyard strikers chose to give up shortly afterwards and go home after a warning was issued by the commanding officers that they had an hour to end their strike. With Canada now enforcing martial law over Boston and our port towns we are pratically left even more completely at their mercy and already they are requesting help from members of the 'Loyalist' Federalist Party in maintaining control."
newengland.104.a:0 "A phyric victory perhaps"

newengland.105.t:0 "Control of New England"
newengland.105.d:0 "New England has come under our direct control! After they requested the Canadian military intervene in a syndicalist strike, the commanding officers in charge of protecting New England wasted no time in putting down the strikers. Now they are left with control of Boston and several port cities, giving us control over their industrial economy. The Federalist Party of New England contains our most hardline supporters and as they are providing our officers with support they are requesting we place them in charge to ensure a more stable New England and see that our losses were not for nothing. However, there are those in parliament who argue that more direct control would be more favorable to our cause and allow us to completely subdue the New English. By appointing a Governor-General, the leader of New England would report directly to us, and we could send directives for governing New England as we see fit. Should we trust these Federalists, take a more direct role, or leave them alone?"
newengland.105.a:0 "Appoint them"
newengland.105.b:0 "A more heavy-handed approach"
newengland.105.c:0 "No, we should not intervene too heavily"

newengland.106.t:0 "The Federalist Party Appointed!"
newengland.106.d:0 "Canada has requested we begin to step down and allow the Federalist Party to take charge, offering us political security and funding in return for accepting the offer. It is clear they are not asking however and as we have virtually no means to oppose them as we gifted them much of our military and economic might. With the Vanderbilt and Astor families already competing for power within the Federalist machine to prepare for Canadian appointments, Radicals are already furious at the idea of English royalists seizing the nation and have stated their intent to declare a revolution, but do not have quite enough resources to do so. Perhaps it would be better to endorse the Radical cause and provide it with our remaining military and political aid to pressure Canada to leave, effectively allowing us to play both sides, although many would see this as a dangerous ploy when Canada offers us security."
newengland.106.a:0 "Allow the Federalists to take charge"
newengland.106.b:0 "Request aid from the Radicals!"

newengland.1060.t:0 "The Canadians Appoint a Governor-General"
newengland.1060.d:0 "In the wake of the recent chaos in New England, Canada has taken a radical step. Trusting neither the native-but-loyal Federalists or the democratic factions, they have instead searched for someone to fill the role of "Governor-General" in New England. This person would answer directly to Ottawa and serve their interests in the region, while also likely having some American ties. The Federalists, New Englanders who wished to be the ones to fulfill these roles in the service of their northern neighbor, are outraged by Canada's decision. They argue that the move is unnecessary and that they would have done a better job of maintaining stability. Regardless, it is said that the main candidates for appointment to New England are Baron Fairhaven, a man with ties to both Britain and the wealthy Rogers family, the popular fiction author August Derleth, and the wealthy Cornelius Vanderbilt III. Canada is set to inform us of their choice at noon today, and they have chosen..."
newengland.1060.a:0 "Baron Fairhaven" 
newengland.1060.b:0 "August Derleth"
newengland.1060.c:0 "Cornelius Vanderbilt III"

newengland.1061.t:0 "New Executive Powers"
newengland.1061.d:0 "With the appointment of the Governor-General, it seems the largest problem in his way will be the local governors. These men are accustomed to holding significant power in their respective states, and some of them obviously expected to rule the region in its entirety. James Michael Curley, accustomed to being in charge of Boston and by extension the most powerful state in New England, has been the most vocal critic of this new system, and men like him will only get in our way. As such, we must grant new powers to the Governor-General, but whatever we do, we must tread carefully. Should we grant the Governor-General new powers over the military, increase his legislative powers, or allow him to override any decisions the courts make?"
newengland.1061.a:0 "Give him greater control over the military"
newengland.1061.b:0 "Help him sideline Congress"
newengland.1061.c:0 "Grant him power over the meddlesome courts"

newengland.1062.t:0 "The Oath of Loyalty"
newengland.1062.d:0 "Today, hundreds of politicians across New England are swearing oaths of loyalty to our new government as well as the King in Canada. Through these oaths, we can find out who is willing to prove their loyalty, and who still harbors sympathies for traitors. As the sun rises on New England, these words are heard: "I swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King [CAN.GetLeader], King of New England, His Heirs and Successors, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of the Dominion of New England, and fulfill my duties as an imperial citizen." With this oath complete, we have endeared our most prominent politicians to the Dominionist government, and now their commitment to the imperial cause is recorded for all to see."
newengland.1062.a:0 "God Save the King!"

newengland.1063.t:0 "Everyday Life in New England"
newengland.1063.d:0 "Now that our political crises have largely abated, life has returned to normal in New England. Our children learn about the British Empire and the Weltkrieg in their history classes, and the newest innovations in Canadian science have made science classes more useful than ever for the rising generation. Our workers enjoy their mornings more than ever, with more than enough maple syrup and tea to go around. The King's men keep order in the factories and stomp out any leftist revolts in their infancy, giving our workers a sense of security they have been missing for a long time. Infrastructure programs and lax borders have led to many reunions among those in New England with old British family ties and their kin in Canada. Our markets swell with products from every corner of the Entente, and our treasury has only grown as a result of our trade with our imperial allies.It is the beginning of a new day in New England!"
newengland.1063.a:0 "Soon we shall be the jewel of the empire!" 

newengland.1064.t:0 "Coronation in Boston"
newengland.1064.d:0 "King [CAN.GetLeader] arrived in Boston today, along with an escort of hundreds of important Canadian and British officials, all to oversee his coronation as king of New England. The region has obviously not had a king in quite some time, and the crowning of [CAN.GetLeader] will be a stark contrast to the Boston Tea Party over a century and a half ago. As this is an unprecedented event in New England, and local officials are unsure of how to conduct a coronation, the Coronation Committee has stepped in to help plan this magnificent event. For his part, King [CAN.GetLeader] did not want a lavish ceremony at first, yet his advisors were able to convince him to engage in one due to the morale victory it would give his people and the symbolic justice of it all. \n\n As the King was anointed, crowned, and enthroned, the empire celebrated the return of New England to its rightful home. New coins and stamps have been minted to further demonstrate the King's ties to New England, and the Governor-General was only one of several dominion leaders present to renew their allegiance to the King. This was also one of the first events of the sort to include media coverage, and people all across New England and the wider empire tuned in on their radios or televisions. As the return procession began with thousands returning to Ottawa and elsewhere, it was clear to all observers that this was a new day in New England."
newengland.1064.a:0 "Long live our noble King!"

newengland.1065.t:0 "Viscount Kennedy?"
newengland.1065.d:0 "Joseph P. Kennedy, a highly influential New England politician, is one of the first men we have considered for a new royal title. Given the contrast between his power and his insecurities about his Irish heritage, he would be a prime candidate to endear to Canada and the royal cause. For his whole life, Kennedy had been discriminated against for his Irish background, with much of high society failing to accept him and even snubbing his family. Now would be his chance to leapfrog these socialites and find his way into imperial high society. As a result, his businesses will surely prosper and his prestige will only continue to grow. However, given his business interests in Hollywood, perhaps he is more interested in American business than he is in Entente business, meaning we would need to put some trust in the man if we are to grant him the title of viscount. Should we do it?"
newengland.1065.a:0 "Yes, make him Viscount Kennedy!"
newengland.1065.b:0 "Let's look at some other candidates..."

newengland.1066.t:0 "Baron Rockefeller?"
newengland.1066.d:0 "Nelson Rockefeller is one of the wealthier men in New England, and as such, his position merits a royal title. Though he was a poor student in school and is still fairly young, the government in Ottawa believes that he would serve the crown well as a baron, due to the influence of his family and his own high discipline, making him a safe choice for such a title. However, we should take care with this appointment: appointing people merely for their wealth could set a precedent and cause the elites we do not like to also demand titles. Since he wishes to personally join the political scene as soon as possible, we could grant him this title as a sort of endorsement, and justify it that way. What should we do?"
newengland.1066.a:0 "Yes, let's jumpstart his career!"
newengland.1066.b:0 "He is not worthy of the title..."

newengland.1067.t:0 "Earl Nahant?"
newengland.1067.d:0 "Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. is quite powerful in New England, particularly Massachusetts, being one of the few Republicans with any power in the region. Now that New England is a dominion, he is worthy of a title. His birth in Nahant, Massachusetts, a small town, hides the fact that he is the head of a family with a long history of positions in government. As such, we believe that he is worthy of the title "Earl of Nahant", which would bring him to our side politically and also demonstrate to our people that long family lines will be rewarded, so long as they are loyal. Giving someone with a reputation and level of fame such as Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. may be just the message we want to send, but similarly to Rockefeller, we may need to be careful of sending the wealthy the wrong message. Should we grant Lodge the title of earl?
newengland.1067.a:0 "Yes, he deserves it!
newengland.1067.b:0 "This would make Kennedy angry..."

newengland.1068.t:0 "Wiping the Boston Tea Party from History"
newengland.1068.d:0 "For as long as America has existed as a free state, the Boston Tea Party has served as a point of pride for Americans, especially New Englanders. Now that we have reconciled with the British however, this event is distasteful, and some are clamoring for it to be removed from the history books altogether. It the words of one British-American, it was "a shameful display of disobedience to their rightful king". Instead, perhaps we should emphasize the actions taken against Loyalist Americans during the war, such as the property destruction the Patriots inflicted on innocent loyal men and women, rather than the devastation they wrought on the crown and its businesses. We will likely never shake the perceptions of the Revolutionary War from our people, but perhaps we can make the Loyalist cause a more favored one than they are now. Let us proceed!"
newengland.1068.a:0 "To a new generation of Loyalists!"

newengland.107.t:0 "Choosing a Proper President"
newengland.107.d:0 "The Federalist Party of New England is, in collaboration with the Canadian and New England political elite, taking control of New England as they are placed in increasingly powerful cabinet positions, SPA and Radical members of congress are removed to be replaced with the Loyalists and they are gifted manpower and economic contracts from the Crown. However the situation is still unstable and they have yet to even unify behind a candidate for President, of which the well-connected and pro-Federalist Astor and Vanderbilt families seemingly spending every dime and bit of political capital competing for top spot. The Astor's closer ties to Canada's political elite give them greater comfort to the Canadian elite and more direct political ties whereas the Vanderbilt's are favored by more of New England for their wealth being based out of the region and heavier philanthropy, with their new money extravagances often being the talk of the town (for better or worse). /n/The candidates include the more traditionally aristocrat and English officer John Jacob Astor whose birth in America would technically make him qualified to run for President but nonetheless makes him more unpopular to locals, the philanthropist Vincent Astor who is more popular within New England (by Astor standards) but less connected to us and too personally reformist for the tastes of many Canadian conservatives, prominent yachtsman and card player Harold Stirling Vanderbilt who seems acceptable to the New England populace despite being less so to Canadian royals and finally motor car racer William Kissam Vanderbilt, whom is quite popular in the area but only somewhat interesting in governing if not for his family allowing him to use him as a candidate."

newengland.1070.d:0 "A day after the Federalist-pluralist House quickly elected [NEE.GetLeader] as President as the centrist parties watched on, he was swore in as President of New England in a ceremony that included the Prime Minister of Canada, members of the royal family, New Hampshire Federalist Governor Styles Bridges, James Michael Curley, and various members of wealthy New England families. The whole affair has not gone on without controversy as figures as diverse as Hamilton Fish III and George Aiken denounced the ceremony as a sham being used by Canada to push their own agenda onto New England."
newengland.1070.a:0 "Well it will have to do"

newengland.108.t:0 "Investigate sailors?"
newengland.108.d:0 "As we crackdown on the presence of syndicalist traitors within New England there are reports of syndicalist aligned workers among the port unions. Currently the SPA radicals are already so neutered that these union workers likely pose no threat but Canada is pushing us to either investigate or outlaw unions among ports associated with the syndicalist strikers, and law and order figures are pressuring us to listen to them. Perhaps it's best to be better safe than sorry."

newengland.109.t:0 "The SPA Old Guard"
newengland.109.d:0 "While the remaining Red Guard militants and syndicalist radicals are being hunted down there remains the question of what to do with the New England 'Old Guard' of the SPA. A more reformist section of the SPA, whom while clearly biased towards the CSA towards opposing a revolution within New England and are ambivalent about the CSA's actual methods. Their relatively moderate stance has gained them political seats in local, state and even a handful of national representative positions. Removing them may be more difficult to justify but as they give cover to the Red Guards and would collaborate with the CSA and their allies in a heart beat it would grant us much safety to do so and it is clearly what Canada favors."
newengland.109.a:0 "Just monitor them"

newengland.110.t:0 "A New Capital?"
newengland.110.d:0 "The news is in a fervor as King [CAN.GetLeader] has made a visit to roaring crowds to promote the "Special Relationship" between Canada and New England as a part of the Federalist-Canadian co-effort to promote relations. Recently our advisors have heard from the Great North that Canadian advisors to the King have heard a rumor we might move the Capital to Concord to have a closer proximity to Canada in a show of goodwill. While it's unknown which Federalists promoted this rumor, we do now that doing so during the King's visit would without a doubt promote positive relations, perhaps gaining us more political support from Canada."
newengland.110.a:0 "Concord is now the Capital"
newengland.110.b:0 "Keep the current capital"

newengland.111.t:0 "Ship Contracts"
newengland.111.d:0 "Using our contacts in the British aristocracy we were able to get ahold of an offer from the Montreal based Canada Steamship Lines which is being pressured by the English government to offer us ships at a discount price. However some in both our government and Canada would rather go a step farther and purchase failing local ports and sell them to the CSL in return for discount prices on future ships. This would incur anger among locals however and be far more costly than simply buring the convoys however."
newengland.111.a:0 "Just buy the ships"
newengland.111.b:0 "Help the CLS"

newengland.112.t:0 "The Hamiltonian Debate"
newengland.112.d:0 "The Hamiltonian Constitution caused outrage the second it was introduced by the party. The few remaining politicians affiliated with the Radical Coalition are decrying it as a betrayal of the Constitution, something backed by various Republicans, Progressives and Democrats such as Al Smith. However with the Federalist Party controlling congress, Federalist Party congressmen Samuel Dickstein and William I. Sirovich gave speeches decrying dissenters for opposing a reform that is not only truer to New England's heritage but will ensure safety. Nonetheless the most controversial parts of the new Constitution, including a provision that would see the both the President and Senators elected for life by electors is sure to endanger only more hatred until it can pass, as would its weakening of the states for Federal power. However, with Canada's backing and the military on our side there is little they can do."
newengland.112.a:0 "Fools"

newengland.113.t:0 "Radicals attack!"
newengland.113.d:0 "The Radical Militants have attacked troops guarding a Canadian diplomat Herbert Meredith Marler, firing rifles at him as he existed his hotel from behind shop windows across the street. Marler was saved by the troops intervention but three soldiers and two radicals died. The Radical papers have either claimed we are responsible for the attacking for 'attacking American freedom repeatedly' or outright endorsed it while the remaining Radicals in Congress not arrested during the Federalist takeover are warning us to stand down. At least they have finally given us an excuse to end them and push through the new Constitution after we have unseat them."

newengland.114.t:0 "Sentinel Offer"
newengland.114.d:0 "As the Remnant falls back their leader Albert Jay Nock has fled for South America while Robert R. McCormick and his inner circle have reportedly taken a ship to Denmark. Interestingly while the Remnant militias continue to fight us the Sentinels of the Republic have come to us with an offer, claiming they will accept the Federalist Party if the DuPont family and other Sentinel associates are allowed to continue their business in the region. Of course, hardline Egoists and 'Radical Anarchists' in the party are unlikely to go with it, but with the wealthy upper core of the Sentinels on our side we would have their wealth resources at our disposal. However, some in Canada and at home such as Federalsit Party whip Samuel Dickstein would prefer to finish the job, believing we could replace the Sentinels with Federalist and Canadian businesses and finish off potential traitors, although it would be an initially costly fight to takeover the DuPonts."

newengland.115.d:0 "A popular but highly potent liquor Absinthe, also called "The Green Fairy", was a popular drink in England before the revolution and remains so in Canada among those who can afford access to either local production or imports from Portugal. Our recent collaboration with the liquor business has caused requests from Entente elites asking for a government approved corporation to purchase and distribute it, which they argue would benefit both sides. While the United States banned it under the Wilson administration under the belief it caused hallucinations in its users we could easily reverse this and approve the trade deal they are requesting."

The Radicals appear to have finally been defeated and with it our main opposition is gone. Federalist Party members such as Styles Bridges has moved to have those Congressmen and governors who did not outright side with the Federalists during the Radical attacks to be removed from office just as the Radicals were and replaced with Federalists until they come up for re-election, although our advisors would prefer if we simply removed them and had new snap elections on the spot for the seats."

newengland.1160.d:0 "Given the President's long presence some are considering if it would be better for him to step down since having the first President serve for life might be a bit too much for many Americans, with some newspaper critics becoming increasingly brave and critical. John Jacob Astor, who is already famous for being a Titanic survivor as a baby, has been using his connections in a bid to 'run' for President, arguing it would be smoother considering the current president has already served longer than what Americans are used to and that it would ease pressure from 'democracy' advocates. Ultimately it comes down us, but if we refuse we will have to do another round of repression of critics, including shutting down hostile newspapers."

newengland.117.d:0 "The Radicals are furious at the attempts of the Federalist Party to take power after their leaders were alerted to their attempts. With the support of our officially rogue state guard they are securing the roads between Boston and Canada to prevent their forces from being resupplied and the pro-Federalist Styles Bridges has been kept captive in his own home by Sentinel forces before he could aid them. Without a way of maintaining New England without a full war, the Federalist and Canadian forces have agreed to return home."
newengland.117.a:0 "Great!"

newengland.118.t:0 "Radicals Take Congress!"
newengland.118.d:0 "With their forces spread throughout New England and continued rallying of citizens to their cause to maintain sovereignty, the Radicals have demanded control of Congress, removing politicians who were found to be too friendly to the Federalist, Canadian or Socialist cause and replacing them with their own, and the Congress moved to continue to support this on a state level. As such, the Radicals have control of our Congress to the enthusiasm of popular writers such as H.L. Mencken and horror to Canadian allies. It appears their American revolutionary uniforms have become less goofy than we once we dismissed them as."
newengland.118.a:0 "Out of the Frying Pot..."

newengland.119.t:0 "Radical Constitutional Congress!"
newengland.119.d:0 "The Radicals have moved to hold a constitutional convention with delegates appointed by each state in New England, modeled on the original constitution. Of course, as the Radicals now control most state legislatures after forcing out "Canadian and Socialist collaborators", this effectively means they will have a large majority of the delegates, with some approved Democrats and Republicans attending, and a small percent of progressives."

newengland.120.t:0 "Radical Split!"
newengland.120.d:0 "Since the beginning of the Constitutional Coalition there has been frictures between the Radicals, namely the Remnant and the Sentinels of the Republic. The Remnant favor a constitutional republic with a minimalist state, but is split on the question of whether or not democracy should be a component of it or if it's too dangerous to democracy. The Sentinels are far more radical, favoring the solution of the state in favor of a "Natural Capitalism", and are led by the DuPoint family, whom are being accused of literally buying delegates with Sentinel funds. In between them are the more traditional anarcho-egoists who are split between a Sentinel force they view as corrupting their message but nonetheless are more serious about dissolving the state and supporting the Remnant. It is likely they will decide the dominant faction. However, if a decision cannot be reached, a maverick is present in the form of Lothrop Stoddard and his Nordic League. Stoddard disagrees with both the Remnant and the Sentinels on many issues, especially the anarchist ideals of the Remnant. However, his pre-established fame would make him an easy compromise, and he has admirers in both factions. Who shall prevail?"

newengland.130.d:0 "With the spread and victory of the Sentinels, the du Pont and Pitcairn families and their allies who are the main movers of the organization on the largest level have taken an eye towards the businesses of the New England families whom aligned themselves with 'Federalism' in an attempt the dominate the economic sphere. With the tables turn, a debate has broken out within the organization, with the Pitcairn's wanting to demand a 'fee' from them for their disloyalty to liberty and the du Pont faction preferring to utilize our militias at once to push them out of the region and seize their territory and businesses to ensure they do not get a second chance to destroy us."

newengland.131.t:0 "Worker's Strike!"
newengland.131.d:0 "Worker's in one of the du Pont's industrial chemistry factories have begun to strike following a string of deaths they blame on 'unsafe working conditions'. This is utterly unbelievable as they had freely sold their labor under contract and are now attempting to extort a business they could leave following the end of their contract or, following egoist thought, if they were strong enough to resist it. This socialism needs to be stomped out at once."

newengland.132.d:0 "It is no secret that many in the Sentinels, especially du Pont and Alexander Lincoln hold strongly anti-Semitic views, associating Jews with socialist subversion, racial inferiority and hostility to Anglo-Saxons. However, not all Sentinels are eager to back these views, with some merely being practical businessmen who would rather cut a deal with Jewish-owned businesses and one of the more intellectual wings of the Sentinels, the Egoists, not being enthusiastic about such plans. As such while seizing these businesses would be welcome to the most militant Sentinels it would see some slight pushback."

newengland.133.t:0 "Independence of Boston"
newengland.133.d:0 "While our combination of dissolving the state with the expansion of the Sentinels and its military has seen the end of many former political entities with the dominance of either towns, business, individuals or us, Boston remains an issue under James Michael Curley's political machine. Promising the population protection from instability the machine continues to exist with its own police force, promising a continuation of democracy on their own level. We could allow this but having one of the largest trade hubs under their control, even if they do not stand in our way and allow us to do business there, would be less than ideal."

newengland.134.d:0 "The state of Vermont under the leadership of George Aiken has refused to dismantle its government and allow the Sentinel form of government to take charge.

newengland.135.t:0 "Survival of the Fittest"
newengland.135.d:0 "Among the top Sentinels most fervent beliefs is in Social Darwinism, believing that a philosophy of survival of the fittest creates a stronger people. However, some of the businesses we have been taking have been pushing back with firearms of their own, and to take the lands of homeowners and force them to pay rent to us would be even more difficult even if we have the largest show of force at the moment. As such, many would have us slow our expansionism to focus on consolidating our men while we deal with these men through contract instead of force."

newengland.140.t:0 "Fate of Democracy"
newengland.140.d:0 "Within the Remnant is a still large disagreement over the nature of democracy and its relationship to liberty. The hardline Nockian and Mencken wing of the party viewed democracy as a threat to liberty for the populace would simply vote for hucksters to take away liberty on the back of false promises or redistribution. The other faction of the Remnant which McCormick leans towards simply expanding the Bill of Rights to make income redistribution and populist economics nearly impossible to implement and just have the Remnant become a political party that defends the ideals of the Radicals in democratic election."

newengland.150.t:0 "The Reconstruction of Tammany Hall"
newengland.150.d:0 "Prior to the civil war, Tammany Hall was at the core of the Democratic Party in New York. Viewed by syndicalists as a symbol of bourgeoisie exploitation and corruption, it was torched when the CSA seized the city in the opening days of the war, and would have been completely destroyed had local leaders not redirected the required resources to more pressing matters. Now with New York City in our hands, we must begin to reestablish symbols of liberalism in the area. Local construction magnates have drafted plans to repair the hall, and are simply awaiting government approval."

newengland.160.d:0 "As apart of our investigation of the political machines in our region, it seems Democratic party leader James Michael Curley is now finally under investigation for corruption, specifically spreading and accepting bribes.

newengland.161.t:0 "Philip Bucola Arrested"
newengland.161.d:0 "New England Mob Boss Philip Buccola has been arrested for smuggling, tax evasion, murder and a host of other crimes. While a conviction for the head of the Boston crime family is unlikely it at least represents their dwindling power he could be arrested to begin with and is associated with the arrest of mafia soldiers as well."
newengland.161.a:0 "Good"

newengland.162.t:0 "New Immigration Laws"
newengland.162.d:0 "When Professor S. M. Terman conducted a New York study regarding the intelligence of children from different racial origins, his findings were astounding. He found that Northern European immigrants or descendants had I.Q.'s that were, on average, 20 points higher than those of the Southern European subjects! This is an astounding difference, and Terman also concluded that superior intelligence is five times as common among those of superior social status. So, having established that there is a difference, we now must look at immigration levels. Southern and Eastern Europeans have higher birth rates than those in Northern and Western Europe, and even worse, they are coming to our shores in much larger numbers. If we wish to maintain our current I.Q. levels or even improve them, we cannot continue to allow such immigration. As such, we have decided to outright ban immigration from such nations, as well as a few Asian nations that immigrants commonly come from. However, we are now faced with a harder decision. Should we apply these standards to impure populations in the warring regions of America to our south?"
newengland.162.a:0 "Yes, apply it across the board"
newengland.162.b:0 "No, they are purer and we need the manpower"

newengland.163.t:0 "Categorize the Races"
newengland.163.d:0 "All in Stoddard's administration agree that the work of categorizing the races is important, and yet, few can agree on what the categories should be. Lothrop Stoddard personally  takes his influence from William Ripley's work and advocates the existence of five major racial groups: White, Yellow, Brown, Black, and Red. Within the White group, there are several subcategories, including Nordics, Alpines, and Mediterraneans. Madison Grant largely agrees with these assertions, though he places more value on the Mediterranean race than Stoddard does. A different theorist, Carleton S. Coon, believes in the existence of different categories, with a Caucasoid race in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Western India. He also believes in a division of Sub-Saharan African between Congoid and Capoid races, while East Asia and the Americas are under the Mongoloid race and Australasia and Central India are in the Australoid race. The ideas of Stoddard and Coons are the main theories in the academic community now, but which should we choose? Whatever we choose, it will help us begin to implement Stoddard's vision in New England. However, we may have to put some parts of our society on hold while we conduct the survey."

newengland.163.b:0 "The Coon Model"

newengland.164.t:0 "Categoriziation Finished!"
newengland.164.d:0 "After about two months, we have finally finished our study of the different peoples of New England and their racial origins. We can now effectively divide them depending on their status, and begin to sterilize those who belong to degenerate or inferior groups."
newengland.164.a:0 "Towards a Progressive future!"

newengland.165.t:0 "Our Friends in the South"
newengland.165.d:0 "It is time for us to decide how we will help our friends in the Klan. Lothrop Stoddard himself is a member of the Klan, and he has found himself sympathizing with their cause in the Second American Civil War. There are several different ways in which we could grant aid to the Constitutional American Republic. We could send a few thousand volunteers and a decent amount of equipment to bolster them, if that is what we believe would benefit them the most. On the other hand, we could mostly send them equipment with just a few hundred volunteers to go along with the shipment, and this would assist in their war effort if we believe they are low on supplies. We could also pick a middle ground between these two options. What should we do?"
newengland.165.a:0 "A middle ground option."
newengland.165.b:0 "They need more men!"
newengland.165.c:0 "They need more equipment!"

newengland.166.t:0 "Degenerate Segregation"
newengland.166.d:0 "The sun has risen on an important day in New England. Today, Lothrop Stoddard has ordered the military and private security forces to begin rounding up the disabled, the insane, and the degenerates in our society and send them away from the rest of the population. Only Stoddard and his close advisors know the details of this separation, but they will not be killed or harmed in any serious way and will be allowed to continue their lives in their new settlements. It will be similar to segregation in the South, though it will include those of lower value even if they are White. This change is for the better; we must ensure there is not contamination in the gene pool if we are to see Stoddard's vision to completion. To be absolutely sure that these elements do not escape and continue to reproduce with the rest of the population, there are whispers that the most inferior groups will be sterilized, so that eventually, only our superior men and women will remain. The higher grades of unsoundness would not be sterilized, but kept separate nonetheless, and through education, we will ensure that our population is enlightened and fully in support of this task."
newengland.166.a:0 "Let us nurture a racial conscience in our society!"

newengland.167.t:0 "Join the American Sphere?"
newengland.167.d:0 "With the Civil War over and the Constitutional American Republic victorious, we are now faced with a choice. Lothrop Stoddard is a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and he has many friendly feelings towards the Nationalist cause, feelings that are returned in full. Thousands of our people have filled the streets, clamoring for us to proclaim allegiance of one sort or another to our southern neighbor. For their part, the Americans have promised Stoddard a good deal of autonomy to control New England, so long as we are ultimately loyal to their cause. This is likely due in equal part to their trust of Stoddard and their current inability to provide for our population as well as theirs. Accepting this offer will be sure to anger Canada, but they have little choice in the matter. They cannot hope to face the combined might of a rebellious New England and a vengeful and war-ready America, nor would they want to, having more important conflicts to worry about with the Syndicalists in Europe. Still, they will surely ask for economic concessions of some sort from the Americans. Should we go through with this?"
newengland.167.a:0 "We will eagerly await the Canadian and American responses!"
newengland.167.b:0 "On second thought..."

newengland.168.t:0 "Helping True Americans?"
newengland.168.d:0 "The Civil War has raged on for years without an end in sight, the Constitutional American Republic could use our help. We have given them material aid and small numbers of volunteers before, primarily in the aid of the NDWL and Ku Klux Klan, but the best way for us to help their cause would be to intervene outright. Such an intervention would not be sanctioned by Canada, and they have told us they will not join us directly, though we know they have mulled over interventions of their own. Should we go to war and aid our Southern brothers, or stay out of the matter entirely?"
newengland.168.a:0 "They need us!"
newengland.168.b:0 "It is not our fight..."

newengland.169.t:0 "Last Bastion of American Civilization"
newengland.169.d:0 "With the Nationalists defeated in the Civil War raging in the south, we are left as the only government willing to do what must be done to ensure the continuation of our species. Not only that, but we are also the only government left willing to ensure its future prosperity, a future in which a pure superior mankind rules the day. It is tragic that we were unable to assist the Constitutional American Republic more in their time of need, but we have solace in the fact that our work has progressed well here in New England, and our independence is guaranteed by Canada and the rest of the Entente. We will now commit to the Entente's struggle with the Under-men in Europe!"
newengland.169.a:0 "For New England!" 

newengland.170.t:0 "Canada Offers New England For a Price"
newengland.170.d:0 "With the Civil War over and our faction having won, the fears in Canada of a Syndicalist southern neighbor are extinguished. The original pretense for their invasion was to protect New England from the leftist brutes both inside and outside their borders, but now both threats are gone, and they rightly believe that we want our land back. However, the Canadians, ever the crafty negotiators, have demanded economic compensation for 6 months for their protection of New England while the Civil War raged. Some of our advisors cry that this is an outrageous offer, but if we want New England back, we may as well just give them what they want and be done with it. What should we do?"
newengland.170.a:0 "Fine, fine, they can have their money..."
newengland.170.b:0 "We'll get it back another way..."

newengland.171.t:0 "New England Decision"
newengland.171.d:0 "The Constitutional American Republic has emerged victorious in the Civil War to our south, and now they are asking for New England back. Though it might be painful to lose New England from our sphere, we have more important things to worry about. Besides, we could extract concessions from them that would prove useful in our war in Europe. What should we do?"
newengland.171.a:0 "Send the offer."
newengland.171.b:0 "New England is ours!"

newengland.172.t:0 "An Agreement is Reached!"
newengland.172.d:0 "After much negotation, the Americans have decided to accept the Canadian offer, and now we will be a part of their sphere rather than part of the Canadian one. This is a new day for New England, and the world will tremble at our united forces!"
newengland.172.a:0 "Hurrah!"

newengland.173.t:0 "No Agreement!"
newengland.173.d:0 "Despite our best hopes, it seems that Canada and America could not find an agreeable settlement to return New England to American control. This is devastating, but we will persist nonetheless!"
newengland.173.a:0 "A sad day..."

newengland.174.t:0 "Better Babies Contests"
newengland.174.d:0 "The so-called "Better Baby" contests are commonplace competitions that have been held in recent decades, usually in state fairs throughout the US in which babies between the ages of 6 and 48 months were judged for their health. Nurses and physicians judged infants participating in the contest on mental health, physical health, and physical appearance. The best children, in eugenic terms, have the biological potential to become the country's future elite. Such children should be given special care, be sent to the best schools and, if they are truly fit, even sent to universities. However, there are voices of criticism that say the initiative, although useful to promote healthy and superior lines, will not be successful because birth does not mean everything. Such critics are mostly from the environmentalist school of thought in Biology, believing that human intelligence and nature itself is derived from environmental factors rather than inborn characteristics. Shall we prove them wrong?"
newengland.174.a:0 "Social support for winning children must be guaranteed"
newengland.174.b:0 "This is a useful initiative"

newengland.175.t:0 "Negro Project"
newengland.175.d:0 "Birth control activist Margaret Sanger has postulated an initiative to provide Southern Black women and families with access to birth control and other forms of contraception. Free access to contraception and abortion would reduce the birth rate in the African-American community and act as a predecessor to more extreme programs in the future. However, this raises concerns that sex education, voluntary fertility control, and abortion accses for the Black population will result in Black communities having fewer but healthier and more active children. Others have argued that such a program would also embolden those of superior genes to use contraceptives as well, something that is infeasible in our current genetic makeup. Some organizations, such as the Eugenics Board of North Carolina, have previously advocated a combination of sex education programs with the compulsory serillization of black women who do not graduate from school. Which variant of the program will we choose?"
newengland.175.a:0 "The segregation so far is sufficient"
newengland.175.b:0 "Sex education and access to contraception costs little and will pay off in the future"
newengland.175.c:0 "Both contraception program and sterilization program are necessary"

newengland.176.t:0 "The Jewish Question"
newengland.176.d:0 "The Jewish question has turned out to be less of a question and more of a fiery debate. It was known to New Englander science that the Jews were not a separate race, but rather a mixture of different races with different attributes. For this reason, there was a problem with their racial qualification. Some politicians and acitvists, like Harry H. Laughlin, opposed any migration of Jews. Lothrop Stoddard considered Ashkenazi Jews as being influenced by Asian and Turkish races, which would make them completely inferior. At the same time, he considered Western European Sephardic Jews valuable to society. Even if they did not keep pure Hebrew blood, any foreign influences would come from European peoples. Many Sephardim have already made a positive record in US history (such as Judah Benjamin and Morris Jacob Raphall). The most complicated (and probably the most effective) of the proposals would involve examining each Jew separately and judging him for his IQ, body build, or skull shape. This research make it possible to find the most valuable elements and possibly obtain them for the new America."
newengland.176.a:0 "Total segregation of Jewish communites"
newengland.176.b:0 "Tolerance and acceptance of the Sephardim"
newengland.176.c:0 "Encourage further scientific study of Jews"

newengland.177.t:0 "Superman, the Man of Tomorrow"
newengland.177.d:0 "Today, there is a new 'Action Comics' comic, complete with a new superhero named "Superman". The main character is not a human but rather an alien, originating from a planet where his kind were gifted with numerous abilities. These powers included being faster than a speeding bullet, being more powerful than a locomotive, and even being able to leap tall buildings at a single bound. He owed all these abilities to centuries of eugenic programs carried out in his homeland - the mysterious planet Krypton. Although comic books are primarily entertainment for children, some people wish to use it in an educational campaign aimed at children and teenagers. However, there are voices complaining that the comic book was created by Jewish authors Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. They argue that Superman does not promote positive values, and instead corrupts the youngest minds in our society. One particularly vocal critic of this comic, as well as the comic industry in general, is German immigrant Fredric Wertham, who argues that comics cause delinquency. For his part, the owner of the publishing house printing the comic has also spoken up. The owner, controversial former military officer Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, emphasizes that the comic book has an educational value and is a manifestation of 'truly American art'."
newengland.177.a:0 "These are fabulous stories for children"
newengland.177.b:0 "Let's use comics in an educational campaign"
newengland.177.c:0 "Comics distort children's minds and must be censored"

newengland.178.t:0 "Sterilization of Criminals"
newengland.178.d:0 "In 1876, the Italian scientist Cesare Lombroso published his most important book, 'L'uomo delinquente' or  'Criminal Man' (this American edition was published in New York in 1911). Lombroso's general theory suggested that criminals are distinguished from noncriminals by multiple physical anomalies. He postulated that criminals represented a reversion to a primitive or subhuman type of person characterized by physical features reminiscent of apes, lower primates, and early humans. Such features are to some extent preserved, he said, in modern 'savages'. The behavior of these biological 'throwbacks' will inevitably be contrary to the rules and expectations of modern civilized society. Almost all scholars, including famous anthropologists such as Charles A. Ellwood, agree that the sterilization of hereditary criminals could benefit society as a whole. For some, such a solution would be insufficient, and they go beyond mere criminals. They question whether it would not be practical to sterilize people with criminal records but also those with physical characteristics suggesting that they are predisposed to commit a crime. This radical solution, however, has critics among scientists, including the late Charles Buckman Goring. They argue that the differences in the physical structure of criminals and ordinary people are marginal and fall within the bounds of statistical error. Further, many lawyers claim that preventive sterilization is incompatible with state constitutions, but they see no objection to the sterilization of convicts. What should we do?"
newengland.178.a:0 "We only sterilize convicted prisoners"
newengland.178.b:0 "Preventive sterilization of potential criminals"

newengland.179.t:0 "Religious Leaders Criticize Eugenics Programs"
newengland.179.d:0 "Religious leaders have for years criticized the initiation of programs to sterilize racially unworthy populations. Now that we have begun to implement such programs in full, many of them have spoken up in dismay. They believe our actions are breaking up families and rejecting God's laws. Catholics are particularly radical in their attitudes towards our eugenics program. After the Pope condemned eugenics, as well as women's empowerment, in the 1931 encyclical 'Casti connubii', most clerics called for a boycott of our teachings and now our programs. Some Protestant churches also equate sterilization with abortion. For this reason they are against it."
newengland.179.a:0 "What outrageous assertions!"

newengland.180.t:0 "Campaigning Begins!"
newengland.180.d:0 "[COR.GetNameDef] has agreed to hold an election with the Nordic Federation, with [COR.GetLeader]'s party facing Lothrop Stoddard's Nordic League. At stake is the control of the nation itself, and each candidate is campaigning across the country today to drum up support for their election effort. The election is set to occur very soon, and despite all the recent strife, it is projected that millions will participate."
newengland.180.a:0 "So be it"

newengland.181.t:0 "Voting Begins"
newengland.181.d:0 "Voting for the national ballot has begun with all parties involved using their campaigning skills and machines to full effect as they either attempt to bill themselves as fulfilling the desires of the Founding Fathers and following the Constitution, or claiming to chart a new American course that will ensure another Civil War and the injustices that preceded it will never occur again."
newengland.181.a:0 "We'd better win"

newengland.182.t:0 "Results are in!"
newengland.182.d:0 "The results of the referendum that will decide the leaders of the federal government are finally in, with the respective governments laying all their legitimacy on accepting the results. The victor is:"
newengland.182.a:0 "[COR.GetLeader]"
newengland.182.b:0 "[NEE.GetLeader]"

newengland.183.t:0 "Nordic Federation Offer!"
newengland.183.d:0 "Stoddard and his Nordic Federation have decided that, since we were allies over the course of the war, the two nations are more or less aligned and as such, should put aside their reservations about one another and conduct an election to decide who will lead America through Reconstruction. The winner of this referendum would become the leader of the nation and  Likewise, with only a few Supreme Court justices still remaining both alive and credible, this would effectively hand the Supreme Court to the victor, and allow for appointees in occupied areas to be decided via an informal proportional representation depending on the results of the referendum. As some in [COR.GetNameDef] believe this is a ruse meant to give Stoddard control over America when others have worked so hard to secure a victory, and they  are demanding they bend the knee to the will of the people."

NEE_LESLIE_GROVES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 17, 1896, in Albany, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in a family with quite a history in the military, considering his father had served in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines and the Boxer Rebellion. During his late high-school years, Groves started to enroll in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea. He would be assigned several times, becoming commander of Company D of the 1st Engineer Battalion, helping during the New England flood of 1927, being sent to Nicaragua in 1929 to conduct surveys for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, and he being assigned to look over Nicaragua's water supply after the 1931 earthquake. It was upon his return to a shattered United States that he gained his last promotions, rising to the rank of Field Marshall in New England, mainly due to the sheer lack of capable staff in the region.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- A brilliant engineer, he has been following closely the development of Nuclear Fission technology keeping regular contact with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner."
NEE_MERRITT_A_EDSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 25, 1897, in Rutland, Vermont, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Merritt Austin Edson joined the University of Vermont in 1915, and in June 1916 he joined the First Infantry Regiment of the Vermont National Guard, where he was sent to Eagle Pass, Texas to work in the Mexican Border. He'd return to Vermont in September, but some time after returning to his university he signed up for the Marine Corps Reserve. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on October 1917, and would be promoted to first lieutenant in June 1920. He later signed up for the Naval Air Station Pensacola, and earned his gold wings as a naval aviator in 1922. He was later stationed in Guam, where received training on semi-tropical environments and upon returning to the US in 1925, he'd take an advanced aviation tactics course at Kelly Field, Texas. He'd later be sent to Nicaragua to fight against the Sandinista forces, and would return to the United States by late 1929. He has since then become the Coach and captain of the Marine corps National Rifle and Pistol teams, managing to win both the 1935 and 1936 tournaments, despite several interruptions due to the growing social unrest. He was finally promoted to Major in February 1936, and assigned to Philadelphia. With the collapse of the Union into civil war, Merritt hardly managed to reach New England before armies closed down the border towards New England. His experience and fame have granted him an early promotion to the rank of Brigadier General.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Apathetic to politics."
NEE_MARK_CLARK_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in Sackets Harbour, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Mark Wayne Clark was born into a family with a great military history. His grandfather was George Rogers Clark, a military general from the times of the American Revolution, and is the cousin of Army General George Marshall. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point when he was just 17, in 1913, but unfortunately lost time in his career due to his constant illness. In his time in West Point, he met and befriended Dwight Eisenhower, and Clark graduated in April 1917 alongside Matthew Ridgway and J. Lawton Collins as a second lieutenant. Like his grandfather, he chose to serve in the Infantry corps where he was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment. He'd later serve in a variety of staff and training roles, gaining the rank of First Lieutenant in 1921, the rank of Captain in 1925 after completing the professional officer course at the US Army Infantry School, and reached rank of Major in 1933 after being assigned as the training instructor of the Indiana Army National Guard. He served as the deputy commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps district in Omaha, Nebraska while doing courses at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School where he would meet old classmates like Matthew Ridgway once more, as well as meeting Walter Bedell Smith and Geoffrey Keyes, with whom he had a cordial relationship. As the internal situation deteriorated, Clark was on leave in New York, and when hostilities broke out, he moved to New England looking for safety. With the lack of capable staff, Clark has been hastily promoted to Brigadier General, where he'll now have to oversee the creation of a new army.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While his loyalty is unquestioned, his friendship with now enemy Generals have raised concerns that General Clark will be unable to do his duty when the time comes to face them openly on the battlefield."
NEE_WILLARD_G_WYMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 21, 1898, in Augusta, Maine, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Willard Gordon Wyman entered the United States Military Academy in 1917 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Coastal Artillery Branch, and later transferred to the Cavalry Branch of the United States Army. He became an infantry and cavalry instructor in 1921, and would gain valuable experience working as an attaché on China between 1928 and 1932, reaching the rank of Captain upon his return. The lack of capable staff forced an early promotion to Brigadier General for Wyman, but he has shown willingness to learn despite being thrown in such a difficult position."
NEE_LEMUEL_SHEPHERD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 10, 1896, in Norfolk, Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Lemuel Cornick 'Lem' Shepherd Jr. graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1917, and would enter the Marine Corps right after as a second lieutenant. He'd slowly climbed his way to Captain in 1922, where he was assigned to the Marine Company that assisted the Brazil's Centennial Exposition and would be later reassigned to the Marine Detachment in the USS New York. In 1927, he was shipped to Tianjin to serve in the 3rd Marine Brigade guarding the American Legation in the city. Lemuel would return to America in 1929 and graduate from the Field Officers' Course in 1932. He'd be sent to Haiti to serve with the Garde d'Haïti as a District and Department Commander, where he earned his promotion to Major. In 1934, Shepherd was detailed to the Marine Barracks, Washington, D. C., as Executive Officer and as Registrar of the Marine Corps Institute and would be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in early 1936. After his promotion, he was assigned to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island. With the country spiralling into Civil War and the Canadian seizure of New England, Shepherd presented his services to the New England Government, earning his promotion to Brigadier General and being assigned to the New England Marine Corps, where his experience shall be greatly valued by the small New England staff."
