### Decisions ###
NFA_seize_morocco_decisions:0 "Seizing Moroccan Territories"
NFA_seize_morocco_decisions_desc:0 "Since the nineteenth century we have fostered ambitions on Morocco. Now that the other powers that have a stake there are in turmoil, it is time to take these lands for our own. Vive la France!"
NFA_seize_real_morocco:0 "Take back the Moroccan Kingdom!"
NFA_seize_real_morocco_desc:0 "The Germans have lost the war in Europe, and it is now our time to strike and take back what was ours!"
NFA_seize_spanish_morocco:0 "Seize Spanish Rio Del Oro!"
NFA_seize_spanish_morocco_desc:0 "The CNT-FAI have captured Spain, and as such her former colonies in Rio del Oro. If we want to secure the region, we must strike now, while the anarchists are still insecure."
NFA_help_spain_decisions:0 "The Spanish Civil War"
NFA_help_spain_decisions_desc:0 "Spain has wavered on the edge of instability for decades, and now it has finally taken the plunge. On one side, the godless anarchists of the CNT. On another, the Carlist pretenders, supported by our Portuguese Integralist allies, and a likely ally in its turn if it succeeds. And, lastly, the legitimate government of Alfonso XIII, hated by the people but a good friend to the Germans. Which side shall we support?"
NFA_help_kos:0 "Support the Legitimate Government"
NFA_help_kos_desc:0 "The only way for Spain to achieve true peace and democracy is through the true government of the Bourbons prevailing."
NFA_help_car:0 "Support the Carlists"
NFA_help_car_desc:0 "The Carlists are the only path Spain has to being made righteous once more. The Portuguese have convinced us this is the right faction to back, and surely, if we support them, they might join our alliance if they succeed?"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_PHILIPPE_PETAIN_DESC:0 "The Lion of Verdun roars from North Africa, casting vicious glares at the Syndicalist rats on the other side of the Mediterranean, but with a twinge of sadness in each roar, for he thought that he would never in his wildest dreams see the collapse of France and all he held close and dear. He had never expected to see mutiny from his own ranks, never expected to see the red flag rising on top of fair Paris, and he had never expected to flee from France in a beat-up old steamboat to Algiers. The French National State is less than a shadow of the glory of the Republic of France that stood before, but something still lived in the hearts of the Marshal and all of those that lived in this France, and that was the insatiable desire for revenge and a return to their homeland. The Lion of Verdun has no other demands but one; that his body is buried in Verdun, on French soil; not in the sands of Northern Africa, and the Lion will pounce again, this time to finish the red traitors!"
POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "Jean III de Orléans, once the picture of aristocratic aloofness, was severely affected by the syndicalist revolution in France. As he fled to North Africa, he became convinced of the necessity of the monarchy in securing the future of the embattled France and its people. Working closely with Action Française, Jean presented himself as the champion of the people in the fight against syndicalism. With the restoration of the Orléans monarchy, Jean aims to destroy the Communards, and extend the monarchy's principled governance to all France."
POLITICS_NAPOLEON_IV_DESC:0 "Napoleon IV Bonaparte is the symbol of a France renewed. Crowned in the Notre Dame d'Afrique with the same grandiosity as the first Napoleon in Paris, he represents the ambition of the restoration of France's old glory. Like his ancestor at Austerlitz, Napoleon endeavours to strike a deadly blow to the heart of France's enemies."
POLITICS_PIERRE_FLANDIN_DESC:0 "Pierre Etienne Flandin reminisces of the France that was before the turmoil of the Weltkrieg and revolution. A devotee of laissez faire economics and quite socially conservative, but also firmly republican, Flandin's vision of France's future is equally a vision of the past he so cherishes."
POLITICS_ANDRE_MALLARME_DESC:0 "André Mallarmé is often smeared by his political opponents as foolishly idealistic. Mallarmé embraces such criticisms; indeed, he is an idealist, but to be an idealist, Mallarmé argues, is to subscribe to the worthiest of notions: liberty, equality, and fraternity, the rallying cry of France's first republicans. Mallarmé believes that though syndicalism is an affront to human dignity, the concerns of France's people must be not only tolerated, but considered. A liberal republic, to Mallarmé, is the only effective defence against syndicalism."
POLITICS_FERNAND_BOUISSON_DESC:0 "Fernand Bouisson, a deputy from the 'Bouches du Rhone' before the Weltkrieg and a Pied-Noir, was well suited for the political atmosphere of the exiled French Republic. Bouisson, a leftist with a disdain for syndicalism did not hesitate to publicly disavow that ideology in an address before the chamber of deputies. Bouisson is guided compassion for his fellow man, and the belief that all French should have their needs met."
POLITICS_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_DESC:0 "Charles de Gaulle, who once fought furiously against both the Germans and Communards, now, as president, battles for the fate of the French Republic. A protégé of Philippe Petain, de Gaulle advocates a strong executive as the only institution capable of guiding the wayward Republic back to prominence. As a leader of men, both in the field of battle and in the halls of the legislature, de Gaulle has proven capable."
POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "Henri VI de Orléans, though but a boy when France was swept up in the fires of revolution, still bears a scar on his forearm where a stray piece of shrapnel embedded itself all those years ago. The trials Henri experienced in his youth steeled his resolve to dedicate himself to France; though paternalistic, Henri is deeply personally invested in his people's wellbeing. As king, Henri seeks to be both France's sword and its shield in the struggle for its future."

### Ideas ###
NFA_anti_communard:0 "Anti-Communard"
NFA_anti_communard_desc:0 "After our defeat in the Weltkrieg of 1919, the communards rose up again and abolished our cherished Republic. Luckily, some of the most important figures of the Republic have immigrated to Algeria where they plan to organise the counter-revolution. Now that the syndicalist traitors have taken full control of the mainland, we must crush them! We must ensure that our Eternal France will always be free!"
NFA_french_in_exile:0 "France in Exile"
NFA_french_in_exile_desc:0 "True Frenchmen are in short supply here in our colonies. Since we only recruit from Europeans, we are having some manpower issues."
NFA_political_unrest:0 "Political Unrest"
NFA_political_unrest_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of our military government, discontent is rising in the Fourth Republic's population. Prime Minister Maurice Janin's recent political blunders has forced Marshall Petain to look for a replacement. However, onlookers are raising the concern that simply changing the Prime Minister won't be enough to appease the population. Many believe this unrest is a signal for the future of France."

### Focuses ###
NFA_industrial_revival:0 "Industrial Expansion"
NFA_industrial_revival_desc:0 "Our industry here in Africa is far behind the one the communards have on the mainland. If we want to defeat them we'll have to strengthen our industry significantly."
NFA_sahara_census:0 "Begin the Saharan Census and Inventory"
NFA_sahara_census_desc:0 "The French Government-in-Exile has had a tough economic situation, leading to several outlandish projects in order to gain more funds. Some bright young mind in a government agency has come up with an idea to make a census and inventory of the Sahara region. We should send out government officials and expeditions to survey the region."
NFA_sahara_census_tooltip:0 "The Algeria-Central Africa Census and Inventory will begin...\n"
NFA_inventory_finished:0 "The Algeria-Central Africa Inventory is complete."
NFA_transsaharian:0 "The Transsaharian Railroad"
NFA_transsaharian_desc:0 "A key component of our strategy is to improve the links between North and West Africa, particularly with our base of Dakar. To solve that, the project of a railroad linking Algiers to Dakar directly was already started under the Third Republic but the project was ultimately abandoned, now it's our turn to take on this torch and succeed where our predecessors couldn't!"
building_transaharian_tooltip:0 "We will start construction a railway linking Dakar with Algiers\n"
NFA_develop_ALG:0 "Routes Départementales"
NFA_develop_ALG_desc:0 "Before thinking of enhancing our industrial output, we have to improve (and in some cases, create from scratch) the infrastructure of the Algerian departments. Unfortunately, they're not nearly as developed as we hoped they would be."
NFA_industrial_expansion_ALG:0 "Dirigisme"
NFA_industrial_expansion_ALG_desc:0 "Before our defeat against the red scum, Algeria was the most developed colony in our whole empire – but it was still a colony, one with low industrial capacity. The glaring lack of financial input has not made the situation better. We should sponsor state-run companies to alleviate this problem."
NFA_military_factories_ALG:0 "Algerian War Industry"
NFA_military_factories_ALG_desc:0 "To reconquer our homeland we need to produce more weapons than the traitors against us. Funding new factories should help us reduce the difference between us and them."
NFA_more_military_factories_ALG:0 "Expand the Metal Industry"
NFA_more_military_factories_ALG_desc:0 "The newly created mines and factories will allow us to build a grand metal industry designed to supply our army."
NFA_dakar_algiers_airway:0 "The Dakar to Algiers Airway"
NFA_dakar_algiers_airway_desc:0 "The Dakar to Algiers Airways was the brain child of Louis Breguet and was designed to kick start the economy in the south of the nation. The competition with German and South African businesses had been a problem for the struggling French businesses and Breguet wanted to help. He was hoping that a new airline could bring more business to North Africa."
NFA_expand_airway:0 "Expand the Airway"
NFA_expand_airway_desc:0 "The success of the DAA has led to Breguet wanting to expand it throughout Africa. Breguet wishes to expand in every direction, but we run the risk of the DAA stretching itself too thin. Should we do it anyway?"
NFA_improve_maritime_links:0 "Improve Maritime Links"
NFA_improve_maritime_links_desc:0 "The cohesion between our Algerian industry and West African holdings greatly relies on the quality of the infrastructure connecting the two parts. By expanding and improving the maritime links between them we can hope for a more efficient industrial base."
NFA_develop_mines:0 "Open New Mines"
NFA_develop_mines_desc:0 "The first step in the exploitation of our West African holdings has proven successful. We should increase the number of mines and start building some basic metal refineries to support further development."
NFA_colonial_resources:0 "Colonial Exploitation"
NFA_colonial_resources_desc:0 "If we want to fuel our industry we need resources. Thankfully, our West African holdings are full of iron, aluminium, and other metals! If we dig new mines and make people work for us (willingly or not) we could improve our finances and reduce our industry's reliance on foreign supplies!"
NFA_cotton_mali:0 "Sudanese Cotton"
NFA_cotton_mali_desc:0 "Recently a French engineer exiled in Africa has been pushing for a crazy idea to develop our colonies and make new profits. Emile Bélime assures that the valley of the Niger in French Sudan is an excellent place to grow cotton and to compete even with the biggest producers in the United States or Egypt. Despite our initial perplexity, we could try and give him the funds."
NFA_sahara:0 "Exploit the Saharan Oil"
NFA_sahara_desc:0 "The Sahara is big and empty, but perhaps not as empty as we once thought? Plenty of Berber tribes live deep inside these territories where our reach does not fully extend. With traces of oil being found in the territory, the Sahara could be the solution to many of our problems if we exploit it!"
NFA_algerie_refinery:0 "Algerian Refineries"
NFA_algerie_refinery_desc:0 "The Saharan oil covers most of our needs but we could greatly increase our production with the development of refineries on the Mediterranean Coast."
NFA_extra_research_slot:0 "New Research Facilities"
NFA_extra_research_slot_desc:0 "Promising young minds are popping up everywhere. We need to supply them with facilities to conduct their research. Advances in technology can give us the edge we need to reconquer our homeland."

NFA_Darlan_Focus:0 "The Darlan Plan"
NFA_Darlan_Focus_desc:0 "The General Strategy of the French State will follow the advice of Admiral Darlan, focusing on defending our holdings from possible threats, instead of recklessly risking our forces on enemy lands."
NFA_fortification_focus:0 "Standardisation of the Fortifications"
NFA_fortification_focus_desc:0 "It is imperative that was are not surprised by enemy landings. If we want to defend our holdings better, it would be wise to standardise fortification designs to reduce construction times. The quicker we have our fortifications up, the better."
NFA_mediteranean_forts:0 "Protecting the Coastline"
NFA_mediteranean_forts_desc:0 "The most important task of our industry is to heavily fortify the Mediterranean coast so as to create a fortress safe from the Communards and their lackeys!"
NFA_protect_the_air:0 "Air Protection"
NFA_protect_the_air_desc:0 "Our coastal fortifications will be worthless if the sky is controlled by our enemies, our forces harassed by their aerial attacks and our industries reduced to shambles."
NFA_radar_effort:0 "Develop Radar Technology"
NFA_radar_effort_desc:0 "The latest technology in detection is the so called RADAR. If we set up radars along the African North coast we could detect any invasion across the Mediterranean while it was still in the planning phase!"
NFA_aviation_home_defense:0 "Aviation : Home Defence Focus"
NFA_aviation_home_defense_desc:0 "Air warfare in desert areas is quite different from air warfare on the European continent. We must take every detail into consideration when designing our air force."
NFA_cas_effort:0 "CAS Effort"
NFA_cas_effort_desc:0 "With no place to hide in the open plains of North Africa, infantry and even armour units are very exposed to aerial attacks. Close air supports with sow and reap death in any enemy formation!"
NFA_navy_expansion:0 "Expansion of the French Navy"
NFA_navy_expansion_desc:0 "We must not let our enemies come close to our coasts and threaten our haven : the French Navy must be enlarged and our hold on the sea secured!"
NFA_navy_expansion_tooltip:0 "\n"
NFA_dockyard_focus:0 "Expansion of the Dakar Dockyards"
NFA_dockyard_focus_desc:0 "We needed to build from scratch naval dockyards following the loss of France. Dakar was chosen to host our submarine bases and we feel it needs to be enlarged so that we can compete with our enemies in the Mediterranean."
NFA_naval_doctrine:0 "Study New Tactics"
NFA_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "Darlan has sent some of his brightest officers abroad, to Japan and Canada, to study the latest expertise on naval warfare."
NFA_destroyer_focus:0 "Destroyer Focus"
NFA_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "While great battleships might have been preferable, it is sadly unrealistic to attempt to construct these with our current industrial capacity. Modern destroyers are better suited to our needs."
NFA_light_cruiser_focus:0 "Light Cruiser Focus"
NFA_light_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "Light Cruisers should make up the core of our modern, specialised fleet. They are not expensive to construct but can, despite their weight, deliver heavy damage to enemy ships and planes alike."
NFA_heavy_cruiser_focus:0 "Heavy Cruiser Focus"
NFA_heavy_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "Heavy cruisers are key ships in any potent fleet meant to dominate an ocean. If we can focus our war industry well enough we should be able to produce a large enough number of these deadly vessels to control our home seas."
NFA_battleship_focus:0 "Battleship focus"
NFA_battleship_focus_desc:0 "To defeat our enemies we will have to destroy them in decisive fights. What better weapons than battleships to win this fight?"

NFA_DeGaulle_focus:0 "De Gaulle Plan"
NFA_DeGaulle_focus_desc:0 "The Military High-Command will follow the recommendations of Général de Gaulle, focusing on building our military forces to retake our homeland."
NFA_southern_conscription:0 "Southern Conscription"
NFA_southern_conscription_desc:0 "Nationalist France had been struggling with manpower. The reputation of the French military had been tarnished by its failure in the Weltkrieg and volunteering was at an all time low. Fiercely national Frenchman could not be the only source of manpower and other sources of manpower were needed. The government is looking to the people in the south of the country."
NFA_native_conscription:0 "Native Conscription"
NFA_native_conscription_desc:0 "The easiest way to increase the number of available men is to conscript the local men into our army and make them fight for us. It was a solution that the High-Command was reluctant to implement because of the risk of sedition from these new units."
NFA_native_conscription_tooltip:0 "You will gain 2 Cavalry Divisions in Constantine and 4 Infantry Divisions in French Sudan.\n"
NFA_continue_native_conscription:0 "Continue the Native Conscription"
NFA_continue_native_conscription_desc:0 "While recruitment from the Northern provinces was met with resistance from the parliament, we still do not have enough men. We could extend conscription to the south, not only relying on the Arabs but also the Sub-Saharan Africans. It should grant us sorely needed manpower, but it will require a lot of political effort to pull through."
NFA_native_conscription2_tooltip:0 "You will gain 1 Cavalry Division in Constantine and 5 Infantry Divisions in French Sudan.\n"
NFA_legionary_campaign:0 "Strengthen the Légion Étrangère"
NFA_legionary_campaign_desc:0 "To increase our armed forces we could increase the size of the Légion Étrangère. Hosting the valorous anti-syndicalist fighters from around the world our Army could become the bane of the Red Hydra!"
NFA_legionary_campaign_tooltip:0 "You will gain 3 Infantry Divisions in Algiers.\n"
NFA_continue_legionary_campaign:0 "Expand the Recruitment Campaign"
NFA_continue_legionary_campaign_desc:0 "Irish, American, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese men will be encouraged in extensive, foreign propaganda campaigns to join our brave, anti-syndicalist Forces!"
NFA_legionary_campaign2_tooltip:0 "You will gain 3 Infantry Divisions in Algiers.\n"
NFA_aviation_invasion:0 "Aviation : Invasion Focus"
NFA_aviation_invasion_desc:0 "Invading a nation across the sea will require us to rely on long distance precision bombers, able to hit supply lines and reserves before they reach the ports."
NFA_aviation_doctrine:0 "New Generation of Officers"
NFA_aviation_doctrine_desc:0 "The so called Young Guards, able and blooming young men of France, have many revolutionary ideas for how to conduct warfare."
NFA_naval_bomber_focus:0 "Control the Sea From Above"
NFA_naval_bomber_focus_desc:0 "While we may be unable to afford constructing a fleet able to rival that of our enemies, we can design naval bombers able to control the Mediterranean for long enough to initiate a landing in our home lands."
NFA_paratrooper_focus:0 "Found the Troupes Aéroportées"
NFA_paratrooper_focus_desc:0 "The Young Guards have presented us with a new, daring idea. Lightly supported infantry could be dropped from planes behind enemy lines and cut off tactically important locations."
NFA_invasion_navy:0 "An Invasion Navy"
NFA_invasion_navy_desc:0 "Our navy is badly outdated and could, at best, prevent the Reds from landing in North Africa. We need to control the sea if we wish to perform a successful invasion of southern France."
NFA_naval_invasion_focus:0 "The Vaisseaux de la Libération"
NFA_naval_invasion_focus_desc:0 "We cannot be satisfied with simply a navy able to do battle. We also need a large convoy fleet, able to feed our armies once we start liberating southern France."
NFA_battleship_focus_degaulle:0 "Battleship Focus"
NFA_battleship_focus_degaulle_desc:0 "Battleships may be expensive, but no one can deny the important role they play in naval warfare, and in amphibious landings. Their large guns can hammer any local resistance to dust before the marines even reach the beach!"
NFA_submarine_focus:0 "Submarine Focus"
NFA_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Submarines are cheap and work excellently to both escort and intercept convoy lanes."
NFA_carrier_effort:0 "Carrier Effort"
NFA_carrier_effort_desc:0 "Carriers are expensive and massive naval projects to undertake... But should we manage to construct a few and protect them with screens, our navy will go from an outdated relic of the past to one of the most feared ones the world knows."

NFA_restore_constitution:0 "Restore the Suspended Constitution"
NFA_restore_constitution_desc:0 "The third republic ended much like the previous one, with a defeat to the Germans. Following the Communard uprising and the escape to Africa, the constitution was put in suspension by Joffre and later Petain. Perhaps it's time to end the military rule and reform to our true ideals of French democracy?"
NFA_restore_constitution_tooltip:0 "§RYou will restore a democratic 4th Republic.§!\n"
NFA_monarchy:0 "Restore the Kingdom of France"
NFA_monarchy_desc:0 "It is a known fact that France has suffered extensively under disjointed governments. A strong character could act as a permanent head of state and offer stability to our nation, in particular if we maintain a strong parliament next to the King. Although it might be tempting to dream of the glory days of The Sun King and restore French monarchy to its fullest."
NFA_monarchy_tooltip:0 "§RYou will restore a Monarchy in National France headed by the house of d'Orléans.§!\n"
NFA_empire:0 "Restore the French Empire"
NFA_empire_desc:0 "Kings and democratically elected governments have both failed France. During the reign of Napoleon Europe was dominated by the proud French people, although even if he is installed we need to determine whether power should lie with the Emperor or with the parliament. Either way, Vive l'Empereur!"
NFA_empire_tooltip:0 "§RYou will restore an Empire in National France headed by Napoléon IV.§!\n"
NFA_Petain_president:0 "Continuation of the Petain Presidency"
NFA_Petain_president_desc:0 "The announcement of the democratisation of the regime has struck many people by surprise. Although Maréchal Pétain is at the origin of the reform, he is normally forced to abdicate his role of President. Then again he could easily retain his position by simply pulling a few strings..."
NFA_petain_pres_tooltip:0 "§RPétain will stay president until his potential resignation or death.§!\n"
NFA_new_president:0 "Elect a New President"
NFA_new_president_desc:0 "The democratisation of the Fourth Republic requires the Maréchal to leave the office and elect another man, one who was not at the head of the junta that ruled before."
NFA_new_president_tooltip:0 "§RA new president will be elected during the next elections.§!\n"
NFA_Judiciary_reform:0 "Equality Before the Law"
NFA_Judiciary_reform_desc:0 "The Constitution of the Fourth French Republic had envisioned an independent High-Court but it was never implemented. We could use this occasion to make all inhabitants of the Republic equal before the law, at the cost of course of alienating the Pieds Noirs."
NFA_judiciary_frenchmen:0 "Colonial Courts"
NFA_judiciary_frenchmen_desc:0 "The Constitution of the Fourth French Republic had envisioned an independent High-Court but it was never implemented. We should reaffirm that French and colonised are not equal before the law by confirming the existence of colonial courts for the locals."
NFA_extended_suffrage:0 "Extended Suffrage"
NFA_extended_suffrage_desc:0 "The upcoming elections require us to delimit who will be able to vote. Traditionally the colonised could not vote, leaving the Algerian assembly dominated by the Pied-Noirs minority. We could begin to open the suffrage to good servants and those who serve in the military, to improve our relations with the locals."
NFA_limited_suffrage:0 "Pieds-Noirs Suffrage"
NFA_limited_suffrage_desc:0 "Some of the locals have asked to vote in the upcoming elections as citizens of the French Republic. We need to reaffirm that only French people can vote, and not the inferior peoples of the colonies!"
NFA_Constitutionalism:0 "Constitutional Monarchy"
NFA_Constitutionalism_desc:0 "The reestablishment of our head of state has allowed the French people to be more united but our leader knows that he can't rule alone, and most of the old Constitution will be used for the new regime."
NFA_constit_mon_tooltip:0 "§RThe new rule shall be constitutional!§!\n"
NFA_Absolutism:0 "Absolutism"
NFA_Absolutism_desc:0 "The Republic has failed France and we need a strong hand to rule our people! By putting our faith in our head of state and God we are sure retake our lost home from the Reds!"
NFA_absolutism_tooltip:0 "§RA strong central power is needed!§!\n"
NFA_puppet_chamber:0 "Anti-Parlementarisme"
NFA_puppet_chamber_desc:0 "The new regime could use the old distrust between the French people and the Assembly to justify the new methods to rule France."
NFA_monarch_prestige:0 "Idealised Sovereign"
NFA_monarch_prestige_desc:0 "Our monarch is a great, liberal and strong sovereign. At least that's what the people should be thinking after we have 'convinced' them."

NFA_legionary_motorization:0 "Divisions Motorisées"
NFA_legionary_motorization_desc:0 "What we lack in sheer men we must counter with better tactics. Instead of relying on slow infantry we could cut into the enemy lines with motorised infantry and win more easily!"
NFA_tank_research:0 "Tank Research"
NFA_tank_research_desc:0 "Tanks will prove themselves to be the most important vehicle of any war, or so De Gaulle claims. It's time we invest in them."
NFA_troupes_de_marine:0 "The Troupes de Marine"
NFA_troupes_de_marine_desc:0 "Key figures in the French military have recently proposed an idea on how to reclaim mainland France. The Troupes de Marine, until now part of the Troupes Coloniales, would become an entirely separate branch of the French military. The marines would receive funding, and be able to better train new marine forces for any future invasion of France itself."
NFA_mountain_elites:0 "Legacy of the Chasseurs Alpins"

### Events ###
nfa.1.t:0 "The situation of National France in 1936"
nfa.1.d:0 "The Third Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Communist Revolution at home. In the aftermath of the French Communal Revolution, the whole apparatus of state and French military, sheltered in Marseille, quickly embarked with the French Navy to Algiers, fleeing the newly created Commune of France. After the peace negotiations with Germany, the French refugee politicians decided to start from scratch again, proclaiming the French Fourth Republic, in exile in Africa but claiming the French motherland. Soon, it was obvious that the parliamentarian regime was outdated, as the exiled leading politicians were mainly nationalists and authoritarian : the military subsequently seized the executive powers, under the leadership of popular marshal Ferdinand Foch. After his death in 1929, the victor of Verdun, Philippe Pétain, took his place, helped by his protégé, admiral François Darlan. Although the military regime of the French Republic in exile, still allied with the British monarchy in exile, has coalesced and stabilised, it still faces numerous threats. Will National France be ready to retake the fatherland in spite of the increasing troubles with the native populations, tired of French authority, or with the Young Guard represented by colonel Charles de Gaulle?"

The day after, the military broke in and arrested all of those in sight, the hideout was sacked and all evidences were recuperated, 17 Algerian nationalists and the young Pied-Noir, Albert Camus of his name were brought to the police station.\nDuring an initial interrogation, Albert swore he never did anything to actually help the Algerians but were merely observing them, this stance wasn't very convincing but it will be for the court to judge."

Loyal to the French authority and, even if he couldn't even speak French, considered 'the Bey of the Frenchmen'; we'll miss this close collaborator for the efficiency of the Protectorate. His successor will be less the subject of the praises of our government, Moncef Bey as he is called now has been known since more than 15 years to hold very nationalist opinions and to have worked closely with members of the nationalist party Destour before the party got banned in the early 1920's. Needless to say he will try to further his cause to the French authorities and is likely to cause us problems, the resident-general in Tunisia and our officials will have to stay in a state of alert."

If the previous Bey accepted this without batting an eye it's not the same for the new nationalist Bey, he formally denounced what he sees as exploitation of the Tunisian people for French wars that do not concern them and asked to put a stop to the conscription in Tunisia. While we still have important power over him, his symbolic authority is strong and the Bey is loved and respected amongst the population. At the end of his speech, it was obvious he was trying to open a dialogue between the French authorities and him, should we try to talk with him or should we just ignore his complaint, as powerless as he is?"

Our support to the Pied-Noirs and our refusal to give equal rights to Algerian natives is enough and numerous illegal nationalist groups, popular protesters and even intellectuals that used to be friendly to the French authority like Fehrat Abbas have suddenly taken the street in Algiers, demanding equal rights with Frenchmen, the recognition of a separate Algerian identity and the liberation of the most important nationalist leaders jailed in previous protests with amongst them the famous Messali Hadj. Of course this protest was completely illegal and was accompanied by several acts of violence, furthermore their positions are not one to please our point of view. But on the other hand, repressing them harshly could lead to even greater problems, what shall we do?"

But protest after protest, it was obvious that their relative peacefulness wouldn't last. This afternoon in Constantine, a protest of radical nationalist elements degenerated as protesters and policemen fought each other in the streets, destroying the glasses of several shops and frightening the neighbours, no-one can say who started this disaster but one thing is sure: it has to be stopped. The army already proposed its help in dealing with them."

nfa.120.d:0 "The terrible crackdown on Algerian nationalists and protests ended the short time of dissent we were experiencing and made us come back to the usual relative peacefulness of Algeria. In this area, our policy looked successful at first but we are now seeing the disadvantages of it. Indeed, our actions radicalised a part of the nationalist movement heavily and even if they are condemned by a large part of the Algerian opposition they still have enough power to be dangerous and already threatened us of leading a struggle to death for the independence of Algeria. We must prepare for possible terror attacks or guerrilla wars."

nfa.121.d:0 "Boom! That's what the inhabitants of the European district of Constantine have heard instead of the bells of the church at the stroke of noon. The market of Constantine has been devastated by a bomb posed by an Algerian terrorist and in the panic, we could count 15, or 16, maybe 17 deaths. The injured have been transported to the hospital quickly but the population is shocked. This is the first terror attack of the radicalised Algerian nationalists, they claim that Constantine was legitimate to be striked first due to being the centre of the repression against their brothers during the protests. More moderate elements condemned this attack but it didn't prevent the growing resentment of the Pied-Noirs against the Algerians, terrorists or not. The Government announced a new crackdown on known nationalist cells and swore that the culprits will be arrested."
nfa.121.a:0 "Terrible."

nfa.123.d:0 "Habous properties are, in North Africa, properties protected by Islamic law to be irrevocable and which is supposed to be used for Islamic charity. Conflicts between the colonial government and the natives over these, the government seeing it as an obstacle for the development of the country, have always existed but had lead to compromises. When in Tunisia private habous weren't touched and public habous were put to location under a bid system called the 'enzel', in Algeria public habous were regularly seized by the government following its need but here too private habous were untouched. But despite this status several habous properties in the region of Algiers and Bône are blocking off the ambitious industrialisation plans of the government, unable to sell them due to Islamic law the only other possibility would be to seize them by force. This would surely anger some people but it would help greatly our industry in the region."

nfa.124.d:0 "Some of the most famous Islamic scholars known as ulemas protested against our decision to seize private habous properties as it's seen as a direct attack against the religion of Islam.

Magnificent rails run from North to South across the desert and displays the best of the French engineering, even exiled in Africa the French genius never dies. This connection is expected to kickstart the economy on both sides by giving an faster path for the African resources to be brought in the Algerian factories and to symbolically bring together the two parts of National France so that they may never break apart."

nfa.127.a:0 "Very good."
nfa.128.t:0 "Which workers for the railroad?"
nfa.128.d:0 "Now that we symbolically started the construction of the railroad we have to ask ourselves which type of workforce we want to use in majority for this project. We could bring in skilled workers from Algeria, either Pied-Noirs or skilled natives, surely they will be very efficient but they will also be very costly in wages and maintenance, building houses and giving them enough food and protection won't be free. Alternatively we could use a more volatile force of volunteers from Algeria or from bordering countries, usually poor people looking for a job, these workers won't be as efficient as their skilled counterparts but offer the advantage of being easier to please and of not complaining as much. Finally there is the possibility of forcefully bringing in labourforce from our colonies in Black Africa, they obviously have the advantage of not costing anything and of being 'satisfied' with very poor working conditions, they are also a disposable workforce as if some disappear, we can just bring more; the drawback of this choice is that they also are neither efficient or motivated for their job."
nfa.128.a:0 "Use well-paid skill workers."
nfa.128.b:0 "Use underpaid volunteers, from Algeria or beyond!"
nfa.128.c:0 "Force the natives in West Africa to work for us!"
nfa.129.t:0 "Sandstorm!"
nfa.129.d:0 "A violent sandstorm broke out in the middle of the desert during the construction of the railroad. Not happy of seriously delaying the construction, the sandstorm also damaged several temporary houses and made us lose some tools. Consequently the construction has been delayed."

nfa.132.d:0 "The reputation of the construction of the railways is well-known throughout our neighbours, the working conditions in the desert and under brutal directors are terrible and the wages aren't worth it. We are consequently having more and more problems recruiting workers as no one wants to go to this hell. This problem has to be solved for the construction to continue properly, we could make an effort to improve their conditions slightly and recruit more people or we could bet on a temporary scare that we can ignore, thirdly we could scrap this recruiting project and start recruiting Africans... with our own ways."
nfa.132.a:0 "Make an effort to recruit more."

nfa.133.t:0 "Our workers are decimated!"
nfa.133.d:0 "A massacre. There is no other word to describe what is happening during this construction. The foremen are mercilessly beating up the workers when they judge they aren't doing enough, hundreds are dying of exhaustion, malaria, or under the beatings of the managers, the labourforce is totally demoralised and we are now lacking people to finish the railway. Our forced recruitment in African villages isn't even working anymore, people are doing anything to avoid being recruited. Should we make our recruitment policies harsher or should we wait until all is forgotten?"

nfa.134.d:0 "'Tunisia is a free nation!', this is the odious statement written on one of the leaflet found in the largest arteries of Tunis today, all signed by the nationalist party Destour. Hundreds of them have been dispersed through the capital and removed as quickly as possible by the French authorities. Their influence on the Tunisian people has surely been minimal due to their quick removal but it still shows a significant revival of Tunisian nationalism which we thought was reduced to small inactive groups of the countryside after our action against them in the 20's.\nThe fact that they didn't fear anything by leaving these leaflets show, more than their arrogance, that they gained a level of passive agreement with either the population or the official authorities of the Protectorate. This conclusion quickly led us to investigate the links of the Bey with these groups and we find some small parts and testimonies that, while not enough to depose the Bey altogether, are enough to confront him about this treason. Should we try to confront him or let the matter drop?"
nfa.134.a:0 "Confront the Bey."
nfa.134.b:0 "Ignore this... for now."
nfa.135.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.135.d:0 "The Bey answered to the concerns brought by our Resident-General by assuring that never would he fund or facilitate the action of these 'fighters' according to his own words. He found it shocking that we could even accuse him of it but, he has said, is willing to forget about that if we are ready to consider him better. Many in our administration is doubting these claims as the Bey never hid his nationalist tendencies but some think he wouldn't endanger his throne by funding terrorists and that he must be honest. Which side are we on?"
nfa.135.a:0 "Trust him..."
nfa.135.b:0 "He is decieving us, warn him for his actions."
nfa.136.t:0 "Tunisian Unions"
nfa.136.d:0 "The creation of the first Tunisian unions date back to the awakening of Tunisian nationalism in the 20's before the ban on unions applied in Algeria was applied in Tunisia too. These unions, led by Mohammed Ali Hammi knew the same fate than the nationalit leaders and were heavily repressed and dismantled while Hammi died in prison in 1934. We thought this would forever be the end of Tunisian trade unionism until we heard of clandestine trade unions reappearing in their bastion of Sfax in the south of Tunisia and slowly spreading amongst immigrants of the south in northern cities. The main representative of these new unions is named 'General Association of the Tunisian Workers' and is led by Tahar Haddad, known for being a nationalist and therefore uniting two of our greatest enemies.\nIt's obvious that this corrupt organisation must be taken down, what if it was helped by Communard spies and agitators? Something surprising though is that the Tunisian authorities didn't already strike on them, they usually know about these sorts of events before us. This bizarre fact boosted the doubts on the Bey again and some of high-ranking officials want to ask him to crackdown on the unionists himself to see if he is being honest or not. What should we do?"
nfa.136.a:0 "Crackdown on them ourselves!"
nfa.136.b:0 "Ask the Bey to make it stop."
nfa.136.c:0 "Ignore it."
nfa.137.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.137.d:0 "The Bey, confronted by our Resident-General refused to crackdown on the unions, citing a 'lack of proofs' and 'only rumours'. This indifference greatly angered the most high-ranking representatives of France in Tunisia and calls for an increased pressure on the Bey have arisen. This anyway won't prevent us to destroy these unions ourselves."
nfa.137.a:0 "Warn the Bey about his obedience and crackdown on the unions!"
nfa.137.b:0 "This was the last warning, ask him to step down."
nfa.137.c:0 "Back down..."
nfa.138.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.138.d:0 "Great News! The Bey isn't as corrupt by the nationalist ideology as we thought and agreed to repress the unions, he seemed visibly angered of it happening on his territory and this makes us hope for a more constructive relationship in the future."
nfa.138.a:0 "Good."
nfa.139.t:0 "The Bey steps down!"
nfa.139.d:0 "Surprisingly the Bey agreed to step down and leave the place to his relative Lamine Bey, he accepted his political defeat and stepped down to, he says, spare a bloodshed that would have hurt the Tunisian people. Though, he obtained to be treated with all the honours a former Bey should receive."
nfa.139.a:0 "Long live Lamine Bey!"
nfa.140.t:0 "The Bey refuses to step down"
nfa.140.d:0 "The Bey was shocked by our demand and refused to step down as the monarch of Tunisia citing his right to govern that was given by its people and Allah himself. Seeing it as a direct aggression he called all the Tunisians to arm and mobilised what he could of nationalist militias he had links to drive out the French from Tunisia forever. While we are reporting this, the Beylical Guard is fighting fiercefully with the French garrison in Tunis."
nfa.140.a:0 "Is it a revolt?"
nfa.141.t:0 "The dockers's strike"
nfa.141.d:0 "The dockers of the port of Tunis, mainly coming from the south of Tunisia, bastion of the unions, striked today, claiming better wages and working conditions. This subsersive demonstration and opening to syndicalist agitators is unacceptable and must be stopped at all costs but we have two options to deal with them. We could send the army and do it by force, potentially angering the Tunisians and destroying industrial assets in the fight or we could negotiate better conditions with them, this would surely stop the strike but it would be a huge thorn in our pride and the elite circles of Algeria would greatly disapprove this policy."
nfa.141.a:0 "Send the army."
nfa.141.b:0 "Negotiate with them."
nfa.142.t:0 "The great Tunisian protest"
nfa.142.d:0 "Habib Bourguiba. One of the rising leaders of the renewed nationalist movement that we spied on for a while, gathering intel about his doings and the networks he is linked to. He comes from the second generation of the Destour, an educated elite that fell in nationalism and that revived the national movement. Well, he is now at the head of the cortege of the protest that took off in Tunis today. Rassembling numerous nationalist leaders, from small subversive groups to clandestine unions and benefiting from our lenient policy they managed to rally hundreds of people to their cause and are now protesting as a provocation in the middle of Tunis!\nAgain the behaviour of the Bey was strange, how come he didn't even hear about this when his servants tell him anything about what happens in the city? He is suspect but he helped us before, could we give him our confidence?\nThis was anyway a fool move from the nationalist forces as they will be crused by our repression."
nfa.142.a:0 "Crackdown on it ourselves."
nfa.142.b:0 "Ask the Bey to make it stop!"
nfa.142.c:0 "Just ignore it."
nfa.143.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.143.d:0 "The Bey, confronted by our Resident-General refused to crackdown on the protest, he refused to give the order to fire on Tunisian civilians, as illegal as the protest might be. This refusal greatly angered the most high-ranking representatives of France in Tunisia and calls for an increased pressure on the Bey have arisen. This anyway won't prevent us to destroy this movement ourselves."
nfa.143.a:0 "Warn the Bey about his obedience and crackdown on the protest!"
nfa.143.b:0 "This was the last warning, ask him to step down."
nfa.143.c:0 "Back down..."
nfa.144.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.144.d:0 "Great News! The Bey isn't as corrupt by the nationalist ideology as we thought and agreed to repress the protest, he seemed visibly angered of it happening in his capital and this makes us hope for a more constructive relationship in the future."
nfa.144.a:0 "Good."
nfa.145.t:0 "Incident in Tunisia"
nfa.145.d:0 "An incident between the French authorities and Tunisians occurred today, a disagreement over the respect of a law led to an increased tension that degenerated in a street fight. The Tunisian was probably fuelled by nationalist sentiments that are slowly spreading through the population."
nfa.145.a:0 "Unfortunate."
nfa.146.t:0 "National France beat us!" #White peace ai event
nfa.146.d:0 "You're not supposed to see that event, please report it if you do."
nfa.146.a:0 "Go back to our desert."
nfa.147.t:0 "Tunisia is victorious!"
nfa.147.d:0 "The damn Tunisians who rose up against our regime have managed to push back our armies and are now dangerously threatening our hold on North Africa. Our defeat is unquestionable, it may be time to ask for peace, a shameful as it is."
nfa.147.a:0 "Ask to meet the Bey for peace."
nfa.147.b:0 "We'll never surrender to colonials!"
nfa.148.t:0 "Tunisia is victorious!"
nfa.148.d:0 "The glorious lead of Moncef Bey was successful and the French are now crawling to our feet for peace. Will we be magnanimous and settle for the entire liberation of the Protectorate or should we destroy them completely?"
nfa.148.a:0 "We accept their offer."
nfa.148.b:0 "The French shall be destroyed entirely."
nfa.149.t:0 "Tunisia accepted our offer"
nfa.149.d:0 "The Bey accepted our gracious offer for the liberation of the Tunisian protectorate and we now have to make this agreement effective."
nfa.149.a:0 "Shame devours France."
nfa.150.t:0 "French invasion of Morocco!"
nfa.150.d:0 "Following the collapse of the once great German Empire, and our newfound independence, the French in Africa have taken it upon themselves to demand from us our territory, or risk facing war. What say we?"
nfa.150.a:0 "We've no choice but to surrender..."
nfa.150.b:0 "We shall fight to the end!"
nfa.151.t:0 "The Moroccans have resisted!"
nfa.151.d:0 "Foolishly, it seems as though the Moroccans have decided to snub our demands and will not be giving us our rightful territory. This is an act of aggression against France, and must surely be dealt with at once."
nfa.151.a:0 "Unfortunately, we are not yet ready for war..."
nfa.151.b:0 "It is time to attack!"
nfa.152.t:0 "The Return of Haute-Savoie"
nfa.152.d:0 "In the violence and confusion that followed our retreat to Africa, French land in Haute-Savoie had fallen under the protection of the Swiss government. Now that we have returned, it is time to consider re-establishing our territorial integrity and demand the return of these French posessions."
nfa.152.a:0 "Demand Haute-Savoie returned."
nfa.152.b:0 "We have more pressing concerns."
nfa.153.t:0 "France Demands Haute-Savoie"
nfa.153.d:0 "A point of contention between the Commune of France and us has always been the fate of Haute-Savoie. We took control of the region in order to protect it's mandated neutrality during the reign of the Syndacalists in Paris. Now that the legitimate government has returned and is demanding its return, now may be time to relinquish our control."
nfa.153.a:0 "France will have Haute-Savoie."
nfa.153.b:0 "We can't risk angering the government in Paris."
nfa.153.c:0 "Haute-Savoie will remain in our posession."
nfa.154.t:0 "Switzerland refuses our demand!"
nfa.154.d:0 "By all rights Haute-Savoie is French. Whatever reasons the Swiss have for rejecting our demands are without merit. We must decide how to respond to this assault."
nfa.154.a:0 "Perhaps Switzerland should keep it."
nfa.154.b:0 "Sever Diplomatic ties and embargo them."
nfa.154.c:0 "To war!"
nfa.155.t:0 "Joining the legitimate French government"
nfa.155.d:0 "Our recent liberation from our oppressive overlord raises the question of the goal of the existence of our country. Started as a satellite in an occupied France, we now have full power over our land but not much use for it. Near us lays the National government of France that descends from the legitimate government of the Third Republic and claims ownership of our controlled territory. A lot of our citizens also look forward to this other government and do not understand why we are making a satellite state last. Should we join with National France or should we declare ourself a legitimate authority on the region?"
nfa.155.a:0 "Ask National France for an union of our states."
nfa.155.b:0 "We are the only legitimate power in France."
nfa.156.t:0 "The French meet the French"
nfa.156.d:0 "The former French puppet government in Paris has been recently liberated and, following a new foreign policy, decided to consider us the rightful French government and ask for an union of our authorities. We are obviously very happy to hear that and hope Frenchmen will continue rallying together."
nfa.156.a:0 "Hurrah!"
nfa.157.t:0 "Monaco Reborn?"
nfa.157.d:0 "An interesting proposal has reached us; recreating the Principality of Monaco.\n\nSince 1860 they have been independent and free, but after we were pushed out of the mainland the Commune saw fit to remove their sovereignty and integrate them.\n\nThere is no reason to reverse this of course and it would be easier to leave things be, but then again, it could work to our benefit to show the French people we aren't like the Commune and will work to undo every unjust act they committed. It should also be noted that their heir to throne fought for us in the Weltkrieg and perhaps we should reward that service."
nfa.157.a:0 "What a good idea!"
nfa.157.b:0 "It is not worth the trouble."

nfa.158.t:0 "Joining Mitteleuropa"
nfa.158.d:0 "As part of the agreements hammered out at the outset of the Second Weltkrieg, [ROOT.GetNameDef] wass to join [GER.GetNameDef]'s economic sphere, known internationally as Mitteleuropa, once our European territory was restored. There are few downsides to this arrangement but, ever since we returned to Paris, nationalists have railed against \"German subjugation\" of France. We could always betray the terms agreed upon in the Conference - *if* we are willing to pay the price..."
nfa.158.a:0 "We honour our agreements."
nfa.158.b:0 "...What agreement?"

nfa.159.t:0 "The Entente's Betrayal"
nfa.159.d:0 "It seems that the Entente has shown its true face. We have honoured our side of the agreements hammered out at the outset of the war, and France now once again controls Paris with our help. But it is not enough. [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has stated its refusal to join Mitteleuropa, citing \"misunderstandings\" regarding the exact terms. Not unexpected, but a vile betrayal nonetheless."
nfa.159.a:0 "They will pay for this!"
