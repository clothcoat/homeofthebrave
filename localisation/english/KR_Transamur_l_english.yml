### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ALEXANDR_KOLCHAK_DESC:0 "Once a polar explorer and commander in the Imperial Russian Navy, who had also fought in both the Russo-Japanese War and the Weltkrieg, Kolchak had tried to proclaim himself the 'Supreme Ruler of Russia' but failed to garner enough support. His relations with the newly created Russian Republic's government were quite hostile due to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which they had agreed to and signed, and had only worsened in 1925 after Kolchak's unsuccessful coup d'etat against the 'German lapdogs'. The rogue admiral managed to flee Russia and found shelter in the pro-Japanese state of Transamur. Now an effective puppet state of Tokyo, Kolchak is trying to gather enough power and support to overthrow the government in Petrograd and proclaim himself leader of Russia."
POLITICS_SHUMYATSKY_DESC:0 "Boris Shumyatsky's parents were forced into exile in Siberia because they refused to leave their home. This incident has stuck with Shumyatsky, continually reminding him of the corruption within the Tsarist government based in Petrograd. A former Bolshevik, Shumyatsky was forced to leave Russia upon the conclusion of the Russian Civil War and has become an influential politician within Transamur. Despite his political views shifting towards the right, Shumyatsky continues to pursue the goal of turning Transamur into a welfare state. His past experience as a Bolshevik agitator has helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_MERKULOV_DESC:0 "A former leader of the pro-Japanese Provisional Primorsk Government, Merkulov's cabinet had been incorporated into Semyenov's Transbaikal state. Now, as Kolchak no longer stands in his way and democracy has finally returned to Vladivostok, Merkulov, a son of a humble peasant, is eager to lead Transamur to prosperity. His vast and personal connections with the people have helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_WOJ_DESC:0 "A leader of Czechoslovakian Legion and hero of the Russian Civil War, Voytsekhovskiy has refused to accept the Brest-Litovsk treaty as legitimate. Outraged, he ceased all the contact with the government of the Russian Republic, and left for Transamur where he found many supporters. Formerly the right-hand man of admiral Kolchak, Sergey betrayed and killed his 'friend'. Less aggressive and ambitious than the rogue admiral, and a hardened veteran, Voytsekhovskiy is now ready to advance West."
POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "An Ataman of the Baikal Cossacks, Semyenov and his boys had managed to establish a Transabaikal state, currently known as Transamur, in order to fight Bolsheviks who had been agitating in the Russian Far East. His newborn country was soon subjugated by Japan. When Kolchak's coup in 1925 had failed and the had rogue admiral had left Russia for Transamur, Semyenov was forced to resign and continue his career as military commander. However, the 'father-of-state' has managed to return, politically influential. Semyenov's only goal is to see Transamur prosper and, in order to do so, he is unwilling to wage uncertain wars."

### Leader Traits ###
TRM_shaky_rule:0 "Shaky Rule\n§gKolchak's regime has few supporters and many haters. Most of the liberal minds are in open opposition to him, while even his own generals are not trustworthy. There even is a chance that they will start a coup to overthrow Kolchak.§!"

### Events ###
tram.intro.t:0 "Transamur - Provisional Russian State in Vladivostok"
tram.intro.d:0 "Siberia and the Russian Far East had been a major area of conflict during the Russian Civil War, as the location of a short-lived democratic republic, the rising of the 'Czech Legion' and Japanese intervention. While forced to evacuate their forces due to German pressure (as well as intense resistance from local Cossacks), the Japanese remained eager to extend their influence and in 1922 pushed for the establishment of an independent state in the Transamur region. This motion gained the support of the Vladivostok business community, despite the fact that it left them vulnerable to forming an economic dependency on Japan. The majority of the business community, however, saw economic and diplomatic relations with the rising power in the East as a significant advantage, especially when compared to the alternative of being sucked further into the disorder besetting the rest of Russia. The new nation gained a prominent figurehead in the form of Admiral Kolchak, one of the more successful White Generals of the civil war and the one-time self-proclaimed 'Supreme Ruler of All Russia', who had been forced to flee Russia following his unsuccessful attempt to seize control in 1925. In 1936, the Transamur Republic has become a corporate and militaristic state, and is politically, economically and militarily under the thumb of the Japanese Empire. And yet Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"
tram.intro.a:0 "Interesting..."

tram.1.t:0 "Transamur Breaks Away!"
tram.1.d:0 "The Transamur Republic has taken great offence at our attempts to regulate their internal affairs, and are severing all political ties with us!"
tram.1.a:0 "Destroy them!"
tram.1.b:0 "We can only let them go..."

tram.21.t:0 "Transamur Invades the Far-East!"
tram.21.d.RUS:0 "Transamur has taken advantage of the unrest in Siberia to establish its control over the region. While this is a great infringement on our sovereignty we are currently very weak and may not be able to win a war to reclaim our lands, especially since fighting Transamur may mean fighting Japan as well."
tram.21.d.SOV:0 "Transamur has taken advantage of the unrest in Siberia to establish its control over the region. While this is a great infringement on our sovereignty, we are currently very weak in the Far East and can not hope to win a war to reclaim our lands, especially since we are still recovering from the deadly civil war."
tram.21.a:0 "It is useless to fight over an icy wasteland."
tram.21.b:0 "Come and take it then - who believe in such ruse anyway?"
tram.21.c:0 "Damn it!"

tram.23.t:0 "Russia Refuses to Intervene"
tram.23.d:0 "The so-called "Russian Government" have seemingly accepted the fait accompli in Siberia, and have taken no serious military action against our liberation effort."
tram.23.a:0 "A smart choice." 
 
tram.24.t:0 "Russia Responses with Force!"
tram.24.d:0 "The so-called 'Russian Government' have not only refused to give up our rightful lands. Moreover, they have declared war on us and aim to retake Vladivostok."
tram.24.a:0 "War it is then!"

tram.25.t:0 "Reds Purge in the Russian Far East"
tram.25.d:0 "The new-established socialist regime in Western Russia has shown that it is too weak to control areas distant from its urban heartland. Our troops have successfully seized the Russian Far East from them, purging what little influence they held in the region."
tram.25.a:0 "We shall suffer no leftists in our rightful territory."

tram.26.t:0 "Russia Refuses to Cede the Far-East"
tram.26.d:0 "It appears that although the illegitimate Russian regime recognises our efforts to seize control of Siberia they have refused to withdraw their forces and allow the region to fall into our hands. It appears that we must now make a decision on whether to continue the invasion and risk open war."
tram.26.a:0 "War will solve our disputes!"
tram.26.b:0 "We are not ready for conflict."

tram.42.t:0 "Transamurian Expansion in Siberia"
tram.42.d:0 "Our client state, the Transamur Republic, has established its control over several parts of Siberia. While this is a fine addition to the Co-Prosperity Sphere it is possible that Transamur is becoming too powerful and needs to be restrained."
tram.42.a:0 "Demand Kamchatka and Okhotsk!"
tram.42.b:0 "It is good to have strong client states!"
tram.42.c:0 "[TRM.GetLeader] is too greedy for his own good, it is time to replace him."

tram.47.t:0 "Japan Demands Bases"
tram.47.d:0 "The Japanese have congratulated us on our seizure of Siberia but the Representative of the Mikado states that we should allow Japan to administer Kamchatka and allow them to establish a naval base in the Sea of Okhotsk."
tram.47.a:0 "Yes, we still need Japanese protection."
tram.47.b:0 "It is time to throw off the Japanese yoke!"

tram.48.t:0 "Japan Plots a Coup Against [TRM.GetLeader]!"
tram.48.d:0 "The Japanese believe [TRM.GetLeader] has outlived his usefulness and have approached the elite of Transamur with the plan of backing a coup d'etat to replace him with a more compliant council of business and military leaders."
tram.48.a:0 "Yes, [TRM.GetLeader] should be removed!"
tram.48.b:0 "[TRM.GetLeader] will not go anywhere!"

tram.49.t:0 "Transamur Submits"
tram.49.d:0 "[TRM.GetLeader] has decided to submit and kneel before us. Now, there is an empty office of the Vladivostok governorship, and so we shall find a replacement. We have a perfect candidate in the loyal general Oi Shigemoto, leader of the Siberian Intervention during the Russian Civil War. As of today, Transamur is now officially ruled by general Shigemoto, having effectively become our puppet."
tram.49.a:0 "Excellent."

tram.59.t:0 "Transamur Invades Irkutsk!"
tram.59.d:0 "Transamur has sent troops and political specialists into Irkutsk, asserting their claim to leadership over the eastern parts of our state. What shall we do?"
tram.59.a:0 "Let them take this."
tram.59.b:0 "No, this is our land!"

tram.60.t:0 "Russia Refuses to Intervene"
tram.60.d:0 "The so-called "Russian Government" have seemingly accepted the fait accompli in Siberia, and have taken no serious military action against our liberation effort."
tram.60.a:0 "A smart choice."

tram.67.t:0 "Transamur Attempts to Break Free"
tram.67.d:0 "With the recent reconquest of Siberia by Transamur they have become much bolder, trying to forge their own way under the sun. Recently they have moved their capital from Vladivostok to more remote parts of their republic, a clear attempt to minimise our influence. What shall we do?"
tram.67.a:0 "It is good to have strong allies!"
tram.67.b:0 "Try to restore our influence over Transamur!"

tram.68.t:0 "Japan Demands Our Submission!"
tram.68.d:0 "The Japanese feel threatened by our attempts to minimise their influence over our country and they have issued an ultimatum to us in which they demand the cessation of steps threatening their sphere of prosperity."
tram.68.a:0 "Submit before Japan."
tram.68.b:0 "Never!"

tram.80.t:0 "Anti-Kolchak Coup"
tram.80.d:0 "The opposition have started an open revolt against us. Disloyal generals and soldiers, lead by Sergey Voytsekhovskiy, have captured the most important neighbourhoods and are now marching right to us. Those who are still loyal to Admiral Kolchak are ready to fight these filthy traitors."
tram.80.a:0 "Kolchak's guards manage to defeat the rebels."
tram.80.b:0 "Kolchak gets overthrown."

tram.81.t:0 "Kolchak is Overthrown!"
tram.81.d:0 "Aleksandr Kolchak, leader of Transamur for more than 12 years, has been overthrown by members of the general staff led by Sergey Voytsekhovskiy and executed by a firing squad. His death opens the field for various possibilities of political change in Transamur including the declaration of a republic, if Sergey Voytsekhovskiy and his staff allows it."
tram.81.a:0 "Sergey Voytsekhovskiy is the new leader of Transamur!"
tram.81.b:0 "A Republic is founded."

tram.84.t:0 "Anti-Kolchak Coup in Transamur!"
tram.84.d:0 "Admiral Kolchak, the long term leader of the Transamur state has been overthrown and assassinated by members of his own general staff. This was used by the democratic opposition to gain control over the state, effectively turning Transamur from a military junta into a democracy. How shall we react?"
tram.84.a:0 "Demand the restoration of a military cabinet!"
tram.84.b:0 "Congratulate the new government!"

tram.86.t:0 "The Duma Elections"
tram.86.d:0 "After several months of preparations the provisional government has completed the arrangements for the first free election in Transamur since 1920. There are 90 seats in national assembly available and various political parties have begun their campaigns. Currently only three parties have a chance of gaining a majority, thus forming a new government. Which one shall prevail?"
tram.86.a:0 "The People's Far East Party!"
tram.86.b:0 "The Party of Popular Freedom!"
tram.86.c:0 "The Zemski Krai Party!"

tram.87.t:0 "The Duma Elections"
tram.87.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every four years. The state Duma's term has expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament. There are 90 seats in the Duma available and various political parties have begun their campaigns. Only three parties have a chance of gaining the majority, thus forming a new government. Which one shall prevail?"
tram.87.a:0 "The People's Far East Party!"
tram.87.b:0 "The Party of Popular Freedom!"
tram.87.c:0 "The Zemski Krai Party!"

tram.92.t:0 "Propose Reunification with Russia?"
tram.92.d:0 "With our chances of overcoming the might of Japan being slim, there have been calls from a number of leading figures within Transamur to set aside our previous rivalry with Russia and join them in order to stave off the Japanese threat. By proposing to join the Russian state peacefully, we could finally end years of isolation imposed on us by Kolchak's belligerence and hopefully avoid subjugation at the hands of Tokyo."
tram.92.a:0 "We must ensure our own survival. Send the proposal."
tram.92.b:0 "Are you crazy?"

tram.93.t:0 "Transamur Proposes Reunification"
tram.93.d:0 "It seems that the traitors in Transamur have finally realised the folly of their actions. Their miserable rump state is at war with Japan and they assuredly have no chance of victory in the face of Japanese military power. Representatives from Transamur have come to us begging us peacefully rejoin our nation, presumably in the hopes of avoiding conquest by Japan. Vladivostok is an important port, no doubt, but, are we ready to confront Tokyo yet?"
tram.93.a:0 "Welcome home Russians."
tram.93.b:0 "It's too risky..."

tram.94.t:0 "Transamur Reunifies with Russia"
tram.94.d:0 "It appears that the traitorous scum in Transamur have managed to temporarily escape their inevitable conquest by reunifying with Russia. Our pride demands retribution for their betrayal, but, is it wise to strike at Russia right now?"
tram.94.a:0 "To war!"
tram.94.b:0 "Transamur isn't worth it."

tram.95.t:0 "Russia Refuses Unification"
tram.95.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to join Russia, negotiations have failed, with the Russian representatives refusing to countenance our peaceful reunification. With vast Japanese forces arrayed against us, it seems that we are on our own."
tram.95.a:0 "Damn."

tram.96.t:0 "Disaster"
tram.96.d:0 "The so-called "Russian Government" have refused to return our lands. Moreover, they have declared war on us and eager to retake Vladivostok."
tram.96.a:0 "Damn!"

tram.97.t:0 "The Russian Republic Breaks Away!"
tram.97.d:0 "The Russian Republic has decided to leave our sphere of influence and cease all contact with us! Our elaborate military-industrial stranglehold over them and their fetid regime lies in ruins, and it appears that our carefully laid plains for increasing our influence in the Russian Far-East are in tatters."
tram.97.a:0 "Destroy them!"
tram.97.b:0 "We can do nothing, for now."

tram.98.t:0 "Attempted Coup in Transamur"
tram.98.d:0 "News about anti-Kolchak coup in Transamur has recently reached us. It appears that rebels sought to kill Aleksandr Kolchak, our de-facto puppet leader of the Vladivostok regime, but their best efforts seem to have come to nothing, with the putsch crushed by loyalist guards. Still, Kolchak has made a number of enemies in Transamur and his vulnerability is becoming increasingly clear. Perhaps we should demand that Kolchak resign and assign a new, more pliant leader for Transamur."
tram.98.a:0 "Replace him."
tram.98.e:0 "Kolchak may be a loose cannon, but he's our loose cannon."

tram.100.t:0 "Admiral Kolchak Murdered in Transamur"
tram.100.d:0 "News about anti-Kolchak coup in Transamur has recently reached us. It appears that rebels have successfully killed Aleksandr Kolchak, our de-facto puppet leader of the Vladivostok regime, and General Voytsekhovskiy has become the new dictator. Although he is less brave and ambitious than his former political rival, Voytsekhovskiy still has great expansionist vision for Transamur. Perhaps we should replace him before he starts a geopolitical crisis?"
tram.100.a:0 "Voytsekhovskiy is the best choice for us."

tram.102.t:0 "Admiral Kolchak Murdered in Transamur"
tram.102.d:0 "The leader of the 1925 coup, rogue admiral Aleksandr Kolchak was recently killed by his own soldiers during a military coup in his beloved Transamur state. A man of great ambitions, he had contested our rights to rule the Russian Republic until his last breath. With his death, our society become a bit more pacified."
tram.102.a:0 "So, the bastard is gone. Excellent!"

tram.103.t:0 "Transamurian Currency in Harbin"
tram.103.d:0 "Harbin is an important city, placed in the middle of Fengtian's territory, and connects two parts of the Chinese Eastern Railway which our republic sold to the Fengtian government in 1927. But even now lots of the Russians live there and play a significant role in the railway. Since many of them have bonds with us, they prefer to use the more or less stable Transamurian Ruble instead of the fluctuating Fengtian Tael, though its unclear if the transactions with our currency are legal or not. Our Economic Minister has proposed that we should make an agreement with Fengtian, which will allow the usage of the Transamurian Ruble in Harbin, but will permit additional taxation by the Fengtian Government."
tram.103.a:0 "Let's propose it!"
tram.103.b:0 "The current situation is acceptable."

tram.104.t:0 "Transamurian Currency in Harbin"
tram.104.d:0 "Transamur has proposed that we allow transactions between our own currency and the Transamurian Ruble in Harbin, which has the largest Russian population in the whole of the Northeast. The government in Vladivostok says that we will be able to tax these transactions, moreover such an agreement could have a positive influence the industrial development of the city as well as the region, where the local Russian business started to make various investments. But, some members of our government mention that the free use of the Transamurian Ruble can lead to the increase of Harbin's autonomy."
tram.104.a:0 "An agreement will help our economy."
tram.104.b:0 "We don't need this deal."

tram.105.t:0 "Fengtian Accepts"
tram.105.d:0 "The Fengtian Government has agreed to allow the usage of our currency in Harbin. We hope that it will strengthen the economic bonds between our countries."
tram.105.a:0 "Excellent."

tram.106.t:0 "Attacking the Petrograd Regime"
tram.106.d:0 "Too long we've been waiting for a chance to liberate our fellow Russians from the tyranny of corrupted German lapdogs and Bolshevik utopists. Our boys are ready to fight, guns are loaded, and trucks are fuelled. Should we officially declare war on them?"
tram.106.a:0 "To arms!"
tram.106.b:0 "We need another month to prepare an invasion."
tram.106.c:0 "We need another half-year to prepare an invasion."
tram.106.e:0 "We need another year to prepare an invasion."

tram.108.t:0 "Setbacks Against Transamur"
tram.108.d:0 "It seems that we have underestimated our enemies in Vladivostok. Their forces are rolling over Eastern Siberia defeating our troops and capturing the cities. Perhaps it would be wise to consider ceding the lands that they have claimed in exchange for peace between us?"
tram.108.a:0 "They're just wastelands anyway..."
tram.108.b:0 "No! It's just a temporary setback."

tram.109.t:0 "Russia Proposes Peace"
tram.109.d:0 "Our mighty military forces are rolling over Eastern Siberia, liberating cities and people from oppression. These cowards who dare to call themselves the Russian government appear to be willing to cede the lands we previously demanded from them. Should we sign a peace treaty or take advantage of Russian military weakness by continuing the war?"
tram.109.a:0 "A reasonable deal."
tram.109.b:0 "There are no treaties with traitors!"

tram.110.t:0 "Treaty of Irkutsk"
tram.110.d:0 "with the regime in Transamur appearing to reciprocate our overtures for peace, it seems that the conflict is now over. Our forces are evacuating from the ceded lands in the Russian Far-East, leaving Vladivostok in control of large areas of our country. While this is a humiliating setback, there is peace - for now at least."
tram.110.a:0 "We have no choice..."

tram.111.t:0 "Transamur Rejects Peace!"
tram.111.d:0 "It appears that the madmen from Transamur are unwilling to stop spilling the blood of Russians. We must defend ourselves!"
tram.111.a:0 "To arms!"

tram.112.t:0 "Setbacks Against Transamur"
tram.112.d:0 "It seems that we have underestimated our enemies in Vladivostok. Their forces are rolling over Siberia defeating our troops and capturing the cities. Perhaps it would be wise to consider ceding the lands that they have claimed in exchange for peace between us?"

tram.118.t:0 "Anti-Japanese Demonstrations"
tram.118.d:0 "Today, a major anti-Japanese rally was held in Vladivostok. Crowds of angry protesters have demanded that we end our partnership with Japan and expel their powerful delegation from our country. Special agents have already identified the agitators responsible for this demonstration. Though we should be attempting to crush these subversive elements, we could instead use them to reduce Japanese influence in Transamur."
tram.118.a:0 "We can't afford these propagandists."
tram.118.b:0 "They shall be useful stooges against Japanese dominance."

tram.119.t:0 "Japan Demands Transamur Control"
tram.119.d:0 "With Japanese influence growing every day, we can barely control the country. Today, the Imperial Delegation from Tokyo demanded that the leadership of Transamur resign and allow them to rule the Transamur, a harsh insult indeed. Though doing so would incur the wrath of the powerful Japanese military, we currently still have the opportunity to expel the Delegation and declare our total independence from Japan. The proud people of Transamur are not mere serfs and if we are going to die, we shall die defending our country from this naked imperialism!"
tram.119.a:0 "On the other hand, we can avoid a meaningless bloodshed..."
tram.119.b:0 "We are not their minions! To arms!"

tram.120.t:0 "A Second in Command"
tram.120.d:0 "An entire week has passed since the assassination of Kolchak and the successful military coup. Now, with the political atmosphere somewhat cooler, the opportunity has finally come for Voytsekhovskiy to choose a deputy to help rule his military cabinet. There are three candidates for this post: the current head of government General Semyenov; young and ambitious general Pepelyaev and conservative Admiral Stark. Though fresh blood may gives us a new opportunities, serious ideological differences exist between Voytsekhovskiy and the more liberal Pepelyaev and Stark will potentially lead to tensions later."
tram.120.a:0 "Grigoriy Semyenov will stay in his office."

tram.121.t:0 "White Refugees in Vladivostok"
tram.121.d:0 "After their victory in the Second Russian Civil War, the Reds have begun to terrorise their internal enemies. Many former White forces and their supporters have managed to flee from mainland Russia to join our cause against the Bolsheviks taking advantage of a period of instability and anarchy in Siberia to flee east. Along with soldiers, several well-educated officers have arrived offering their services. No matter their prior political affiliations, together we must strike at the Red Hydra!"
tram.121.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers!"

tram.122.t:0 "More Exiles Arrive in Transamur"
tram.122.d:0 "A long period of political instability in mainland Russia has caused anarchy to erupt in distant parts of Siberia. With the [RUS.Capital.GetName] government otherwise occupied containing instability in the West, it is quite difficult for them to exert real power over this region. People are losing hope in their leaders and fleeing to our country. More and more refugees and exiles are joining our cause."

tram.123.t:0 "Send Agitators into Siberia"
tram.123.d:0 "With the death of Kerenskiy, the political situation in Russia proper is more chaotic than it has been even in recent years. Some of our ministers believe that the opportunity now exists for us to strike again. We should start with sending agents to push our agenda all across Eastern Siberia. If the people hear us, it is inevitable that they will join us to bring down the corrupt regime in the West."

tram.124.t:0 "Results of our Agitation Efforts"
tram.124.goodagit:0 "Recent reports have reached us making clear that our plan to send agitators into Siberia to spread our ideas was even more effective than we had predicted before.

Although, neither Kolchak or [CAN_king_first_name] know each other personally, this resetting of relations could be the start of a long period of partnership between our countries. We should send an envoy to negotiate for support."

tram.126.t:0 "Envoy from Transamur"
tram.126.d:0 "Today an envoy from the petty military junta of Transamur has come to visit His Majesty, [CAN_king_full_name]. In his speech, the envoy informed us about King George V's previous support of Kolchak's 1925 unsuccessful coup in Petrograd and assured us that this time the rogue admiral will triumph - however, he once again requests support from the Entente. We owe Kolchak nothing, but maybe he's not that useless? How should we answer?"
tram.126.a:0 "Assure him that he'll get everything he need."

However, though the King has promised to partially support us, he has refused to give us complete backing. While the outcome is not as great as we had previously hoped, some support from the Entente is most welcome."
tram.127.nosupport:0 "Our envoy has returned with unfortunate news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed little interest in our cause, to put it mildly. The King said bluntly that we are nothing but a clique of buffoons desperately trying to preserve our rule. He promised absolutely nothing from the Entente and our relationships has definitely worsened."

tram.128.d:0 "The war between Japan and Transamur seems to lose any reason it had before. Japanese troops, taking casualties form brave Russian defenders, were unable to conquer Vladivostok for so long time the entire perspective of taming Transamur may now cost more than Transamur can possibly give in return.\n\n[JAP.GetLeader] and [TRM.GetLeader] meets today in Vladivostok to sign a white peace treaty and end all hostilities between these two countries. It seems that Japan has lost its only tool to press Russia. People of Transamur are celebrating this outstanding victory."

tram.128.jap:0 "Curse you, traitors."

tram.129.t:0 "Moving the Capital to Irkutsk"
tram.129.d:0 "We now control Irkutsk which provides us with an industrial base to build up our country. In order to continue with our aspirations of a united Russia we must relocate the provisional capital to Irkutsk. This may alarm the Japanese as it would give them an indication of our true goal but it would also lower their influence"
tram.129.a:0 "It is worth the risk."

tram.130.t:0 "Moving the Capital to [653.GetName]"
tram.130.d:0 "As our might grows stronger every day we become more and more autonomous from Japan and their imperial ambitions. Moving the provisional capital to [653.GetName] will show them that we are their lapdogs no more."

tram.131.t:0 "Moving the Capital to Moscow"
tram.131.d:0 "Moscow hasn't been the capital of a united Russian State since 1712 when Peter The Great made what is now Petrograd the capital. Since the illegitimate Petrograd Regime used the city we should perhaps consider using Moscow as our new capital, not only to distance ourselves from the petrograd regime but as a callback to the foundation of Russia. "
tram.131.a:0 "Long live Russia, one and indivisible!"

tram.132.t:0 "Moving the Capital to Petrograd"
tram.132.d:0 "Petrograd has been the capital of a united Russian State since 1712 when Peter The Great created it from the ground up. Our government using the city as our capital is a sign of legitimacy and will allow the public see us a the legitimate Russian State."

### Ideas ###
TRM_dream:0 "Greater Transamur Ambitions"
TRM_dream_desc:0 "Ever since 1925 the Transamur government has claimed that it is the rightful government of all Russia, deposed by filthy traitors of Kerenskiy's cabinet. Although the country isn't in great shape, its leadership holds hopes that one day Transamur might become a major power."
TRM_dream_fulfilled:0 "Russia Reunited"
TRM_dream_fulfilled_desc:0 "At last none can dispute our claim to be the legitimate Russian state, with the destruction of both the Soviet and Petrograd regimes our ambitions have finally been met. Now that we are in a position of power we can work on improving the country internally."
TRM_kolchak:0 "Admiral-Dictator"
TRM_kolchak_desc:0 "As a former admiral of the Russian Empire, Kolchak pays particular attention to the advances in naval power and technology across the globe. His personal knowledge about warships gives us an advantage in naval research."
TRM_JAP_MIL_MIS:0 "Japanese Military Advisers"
TRM_JAP_MIL_MIS_desc:0 "Our regime is hardly a substantial military power, and much to our chagrin, relies to some extent on a number of Japanese military advisers and delegates to help boost the strength of our nascent armed forces."
TRM_JAP_NAV_MIS:0 "Japanese Naval Advisers"
TRM_JAP_NAV_MIS_desc:0 "Though Transamur professes to be a serious naval power in the north Pacific based in the major port of Vladivostok, in actual fact our warships are somewhat poorly maintained and the experience of our crews depressingly minimal. To make up for these shortfalls, the Empire of Japan has offered us naval advisers to help restore and expand our navy."
TRM_JAP_INF_START:0 "Japanese Influence"
TRM_JAP_INF_START_desc:0 "The Vladivostok regime has become hopelessly reliant on the Japanese Empire, and the tendrils of imperial influence dominate many institutions and aspects of Transamurian society."
TRM_JAP_INF_TRADE:0 "Increased Japanese Influence"
TRM_JAP_INF_TRADE_desc:0 "The Vladivostok regime has become hopelessly reliant on the Japanese Empire, and the tendrils of imperial influence dominate many institutions and aspects of Transamurian society. Further Japanese financial investment into the region at least offers us some benefits from this arrangement."
TRM_JAP_DEP_1:0 "Dependence on Japan"
TRM_JAP_DEP_1_desc:0 "Our relationship with the Japanese Empire is slowly moving from that of a mutually beneficial partnership, ostensibly at least, to one that bears all the hallmarks of a serious trade imbalance."
TRM_JAP_DEP_2:0 "Increased Dependence on Japan"
TRM_JAP_DEP_2_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly clear to many that our dependence on the Empire of Japan is growing by the day. Ships arrive from Tokyo laden with goods and leave Vladivostok port with empty holds. We have become little more than a market."
TRM_JAP_DEP_3:0 "Extreme Dependence on Japan"
TRM_JAP_DEP_3_desc:0 "Few seriously dispute that our nation is little more than a Japanese lapdog at this point, and the Transamur regime's weakness has gone from an open secret to a blatant fact."
TRM_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
TRM_martial_law_desc:0 "The situation in our country is unstable. In order to prevent another coup, martial law will help protect our people from themselves."
TRM_research:0 "Liberal Scientists"
TRM_research_desc:0 "Transamur cannot prosper without bright minds. By engaging with scientific research we can punch above our weight on the world stage."
TRM_factory:0 "Investment in Heavy Industry"
TRM_factory_desc:0 "State subsidies ensure that our heavy industry sector will expand. No longer will Transamur will be considered a ragged wasteland at the edge of the world, but an industrial power of slag and steel."
TRM_goods:0 "Welfare State"
TRM_goods_desc:0 "Life can be difficult in Siberia. The least that we can do for our citizenry is to provide them with a fully functioning welfare state. It is convenient that it also disarms much opposition against our regime."
TRM_mil_stuff:0 "Loyal Military Cabinet"
TRM_mil_stuff_desc:0 "The aftermath of our recent military reforms has led to a more pliant military machine, something that is essential in a state like Transamur."
TRM_purge:0 "Aftermath of the Purge"
TRM_purge_desc:0 "Restoring the sanctity of an entire military machine overnight is a complicated and frustrating business. It is inevitable that there are consequences. In the long term however, we will have an army worth the name."
TRM_new_military:0 "New Military Cabinet"
TRM_new_military_desc:0 "Our military is now far more loyal to our regime and effective as a result of our recent reforming measures."
TRM_ships:0 "New Ship Designs"
TRM_ships_desc:0 "Our nation is, to some extent, a navy with a state. New warships are essential to our military prestige, and in the long run, our survival."
TRM_supply:0 "Improved Supply Network"
TRM_supply_desc:0 "Control over the Trans-Siberian Railway allows us to take advantage of further infrastructure benefits allowing us to improve our logistics."
TRM_modest_society:0 "Political Stabilisation"
TRM_modest_society_desc:0 "Our nation appears to finally have stabilised, and a new era of prosperity and power beckons for all Transamur, under our new so-called 'Modest Society'."
TRM_JAP_CONS:0 "Japanese Concession"
TRM_JAP_CONS_desc:0 "The power of Japanese business interests and lobbyists in Transamur is becoming increasingly apparent, and the Concession is proof of this. Where it was once European powers that forced Asian markets to open, in Transamur it seems that the reverse is now true."

### Focuses ###
TRM_Navy_Start:0 "Eastern Harbour"
TRM_Navy_Start_desc:0 "Vladivostok was both a major port and city in the Russian Far East under the old Tsarist regime, but with the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war, Vladivostok has lost some of its importance. After the Weltkrieg and Kolchak's unsuccessful coup in 1925 the city underwent a resurgence again as major trade port for the Japanese."

TRM_Navy_Vlad:0 "Improve Vladivostok Port"
TRM_Navy_Vlad_desc:0 "Increasing numbers of ships make landfall in our port each week, and Vladivostok harbour has become overloaded due these endless waves of cargo ships. We shall expand the port in order to ease these issues."

TRM_Navy_Doc:0 "Doctrine Breakthrough"
TRM_Navy_Doc_desc:0 "Our recent efforts in naval researches have resulted in a theoretical breakthrough. It will allow us to develop a new doctrine even faster than we predicted."

TRM_Navy_Ships:0 "Grand Fleet"
TRM_Navy_Ships_desc:0 "Since the Russian defeat in the Russo-Japanese war the Pacific fleet became a living example of misery. As the legitimate government of Russia it is our duty to restore the former glory of our Pacific fleet."

TRM_Navy_Docks:0 "Pearl in the East"
TRM_Navy_Docks_desc:0 "Vladivostok is our great pearl. We must do everything to make our city the powerhouse of East Asia. Our efforts will results in bigger naval facilities and stronger naval fortifications."

TRM_Navy_Old_Ways:0 "Legacy of the Weltkrieg"
TRM_Navy_Old_Ways_desc:0 "A lot of time has passed since the end of the Weltkrieg. Naval thought has changed and new technologies such as carriers and submarines have experienced much development. Still, these frivolous new toys are nothing compared to the old warships. A powerful fleet would crush anything in its path."

TRM_Navy_Cruiser:0 "Develop Cruisers"
TRM_Navy_Cruiser_desc:0 "We are not ready to construct big battleships, so it would be wise to focus on smaller ships such as cruisers. They are one of the keys to naval domination and a worthy initial goal for our fleet."

TRM_Navy_DD:0 "Destroyers of Amur"
TRM_Navy_DD_desc:0 "Destroyers are small fast ships which are produced to escort trade convoys and bigger ships. Although they aren't the pinnacle of warships in terms of tonnage and power we cannot afford to ignore them."

TRM_Navy_New_Ways:0 "A New Path"
TRM_Navy_New_Ways_desc:0 "The rise of submarines and carriers during the Weltkrieg was unexpected. They have since proven themselves to be very effective. Though we will likely still rely on our extant main fleet, perhaps we could augment it with these new types of ships?"

TRM_Navy_Sub:0 "Submarine Effort"
TRM_Navy_Sub_desc:0 "These sneaky machines of total destruction are good for hunting enemy convoys and surface ships. We must have them immediately!"

TRM_Navy_Carrier:0 "Pacific Carriers"
TRM_Navy_Carrier_desc:0 "Naval carriers are considered by many to be the future of warfare on the high seas, particularly in the large Pacific Ocean. It would be wise to take advantage of our position and facilities to build these new ships."

TRM_Ind_Vlad:0 "Initial Industrialisation"
TRM_Ind_Vlad_desc:0 "Kolchak's autocratic government did almost nothing to develop our country at all during the 1920's. Now, we have a distinctly backwater industry, a situation which must be rectified soon. We should start to develop our country step by step. Even if our progress is slow, incremental improvements will result in a prosperous country some day."

TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv1:0 "Minor Japanese Investment"
TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv1_desc:0 "It may be a bitter pill, but we cannot develop without foreign investments. Japan is unfortunately the only country with the will and capability to invest in our economy, however this will inevitably upset our people."

TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv2:0 "Major Japanese Investment"
TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv2_desc:0 "We need more! Japan is willing to invest even more capital and industrial development in Transamur. There are concerns in our administration that our nation will become increasingly dependent on the Empire if we go down such a path. We must find a balance."

TRM_Ind_Dock:0 "Expand Vladivostok Dockyards"
TRM_Ind_Dock_desc:0 "Vladivostok is our only way to construct ships. We need even more dockyards if we want a proper fleet."

TRM_Ind_Khab:0 "Expand Industry in Khabarovsk"
TRM_Ind_Khab_desc:0 "Khabarovsk is our second biggest city. Although the word 'big' is difficult to use about our country, we can expand industry in this city to make it appropriate for our future plans."

TRM_Ind_Transsib:0 "Revive Trans-Siberian Railway"
TRM_Ind_Transsib_desc:0 "We now possess a larger part of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The railway itself in very poor condition, but if we invest in efforts to rebuild and improve it, our supply lines will be greatly improved."

TRM_Ind_Sib:0 "Expand Far Eastern Industry"
TRM_Ind_Sib_desc:0 "The Russian Far East is just a vast wasteland of snow and tundra. But even in this harsh climate we can open some new facilities to develop our industry."

TRM_Ind_Okh:0 "Improve the Nikolayevsk Port"
TRM_Ind_Okh_desc:0 "The port of Nikolayevsk is in poor condition due to the lack of use by its former owners. Redevelopment will enable a new naval base to be established."

TRM_Ind_Bai:0 "Expand Industry around Lake Baikal"
TRM_Ind_Bai_desc:0 "We now have the very developed industrial region of Irkutsk in our hands. It already has strong industrial potential, but we can improve it even more if we open some new facilities."

TRM_Ind_Mon:0 "Develop Chita"
TRM_Ind_Mon_desc:0 "The lands east of Lake Baikal are rich in resources, but extremely underdeveloped. It will take us a long time to build up this region, but we can begin now."

TRM_Ind_Transsib_exp:0 "Improve Supply Network"
TRM_Ind_Transsib_exp_desc:0 "As the Trans-Siberian railway expands more and more, its usefulness becomes increasingly apparent. We now even have the potential to create a nationwide railway supply system to deliver goods all across the country."

TRM_Ind_West_Sib:0 "Expand Industry in Western Siberia"
TRM_Ind_West_Sib_desc:0 "Western Siberia is our primary strategic region because it allows us to directly attack the traitors from Petrograd. A lot of new facilities must be build to make us stronger before the final battle"

TRM_Ind_Research:0 "Siberian Scientists"
TRM_Ind_Research_desc:0 "Our recent conquests have brought many wise minds into our scientific facilities. We can use them to improve the practical capabilities of our science efforts."

TRM_Ind_WHR:0 "Build up White Russia"
TRM_Ind_WHR_desc:0 "The region of White Russia is one that hasn't seen too much development in recent years and so we must work on improving the area."

TRM_Ind_Ukraine:0 "Deal with Ukrainian Navy"
TRM_Ind_Ukraine_desc:0 "Sevastapol has a large fleet. We can now decide what to do with it, whether that be repurposing it or selling it off for income."

TRM_Ind_CA:0 "Industrialising Central Asia"
TRM_Ind_CA_desc:0 "Central Asia is an excellent place to build up some industry, as it currently is lacking in comparison to other areas of the Russia. Let us build up the region!"

TRM_Ind_Caucasus:0 "Improving the Caucasus"
TRM_Ind_Caucasus_desc:0 "The lands of the Caucasus are rich with oil, which is why Germany wanted to have a tight grip on the area. With the region under our control, we can improve the industry for the people who have long suffered."

TRM_Ind_POL:0 "Appeasing the Polish"
TRM_Ind_POL_desc:0 "The Poles are a rebellious people and therefore must be tamed rather thank crushed. We can extend our industrial project to the region to give them the aid they desire."

TRM_Ind_BLT:0 "Expanding The Baltic"
TRM_Ind_BLT_desc:0 "The Baltic states are back under our control. We should learn from the past and not continue our Russification, but instead develop their industry and grant them some illusion of autonomy so that they are satisfied with our rule."

TRM_Ind_Research_2:0 "A New Weapon"
TRM_Ind_Research_2_desc:0 "With the Capital retaken, the scientists there are now contributing to our research, giving us an edge over our rivals. Also, with the industrialisation campaign over, more scientists in the newly conquered regions are joining our ranks. This combination has helped us invent whole new possibilities of weapons to use in wars."

TRM_Trade_Jap:0 "Improve Trade Relations With Japan"
TRM_Trade_Jap_desc:0 "We may hate the Japanese but even the blind can appreciate that we depend on their economy. It would be more than wise to improve our trade relations with the Empire."

TRM_Jap_Inv1:0 "Aid from Japan"
TRM_Jap_Inv1_desc:0 "We can ask Japan to invest some money into our industry. It will allow us to develop our country faster. However, the deepening ties between us will also grow increasingly apparent, which means our people will be displeased."

TRM_Jap_Inv2:0 "Zaibatsu Investments"
TRM_Jap_Inv2_desc:0 "The Japanese industrial giants are increasingly coming to see us as a useful market for their goods. However, by requesting further financial investment from them the people of Transamur will no doubt disapprove of our cosying up to Tokyo."

TRM_Jap_Inv3:0 "Invite Japanese Instructors"
TRM_Jap_Inv3_desc:0 "While Japanese aid and investment has been highly lucrative, our economy is laughably inefficient compared to that of the land of the rising sun. We should ask our friends to the east for economic advisers and request the personal assistance of Japanese industrialists. Such a move could lead to massive unrest among our people, however; these instructors may be perceived as colonists."

TRM_Jap_Naval_Treaty:0 "Russo-Japanese Naval Treaty"
TRM_Jap_Naval_Treaty_desc:0 "As we become closer to Japan, they are willing to sign a treaty with us which would allow us to coordinate with Japanese scientists to develop naval doctrines. However, it will probably anger our people who hate Japanese imperialists."

TRM_Jap_Military_Mission:0 "Japanese Military Mission"
TRM_Jap_Military_Mission_desc:0 "Our navy is reaping great rewards from our cordiality with Japan, which has become increasingly pronounced due to our recent naval joint-development effort. We should establish a similar relationship with the Japanese Army. This will likely lead to further anger among our populace, however."

TRM_Feng_Dip:0 "Draw Closer to Fengtian"
TRM_Feng_Dip_desc:0 "The Fengtian regime is also under a great deal of Japanese influence, and thus our ally. Despite this and our close geographic proximity, our nation has diplomatic and economic ties comparable to that of any other with Fengtian. We should expand our diplomatic mission in the capital of Fengtian to foster closer ties."

TRM_Feng_Workforce:0 "Invite Fengtian Workers"
TRM_Feng_Workforce_desc:0 "To the west lie the vast lands of Manchuria ruled by Zhang Zuolin who is our occasional partner and ally. A lot of poor Chinese people are willing to work for us, even for a mere bowl of rice per day. Cheap labour could help us greatly, but Japanese officials would no doubt use them to increase their influence in our politics."

TRM_Feng_Smugglers:0 "Smuggle Weapons From Triads"
TRM_Feng_Smugglers_desc:0 "Permanent instability in Asia creates good conditions for various smugglers and other criminals. As we need weapons to fight, we'll get it from every possible source. The Triads of the Legation Cities have offered us a special deal. For a certain price they'll smuggle a substantial amount of rifles for us."

TRM_Arm_Start:0 "Begin Militarisation"
TRM_Arm_Start_desc:0 "For far too long have we relied on the Japanese for protection, we now need our own army but this will take time."

TRM_Arm_Doc:0 "Expand Military Staff"
TRM_Arm_Doc_desc:0 "We have a lack of proper officers to command our troops. We must train a new young generation of officers."

TRM_Arm_Commando:0 "Expand Special Forces"
TRM_Arm_Commando_desc:0 "The strength of an effective special forces organisation lies not in numbers, but in the effectiveness of the individual. A loyal commando will lead us to victory!"

TRM_Arm_Inf1:0 "Modernise Equipment"
TRM_Arm_Inf1_desc:0 "We have not upgraded our equipment since the 1920's and many of our weapons are obsolete to say the least. We cannot achieve any of our objectives if we have ineffective weapons for our soldiers."

TRM_Arm_Inf2:0 "Northern Expansion"
TRM_Arm_Inf2_desc:0 "Our nation is exhausted of fighting men, and our current drafting rate appears to be insufficient to populate our armed forces. If we enact conscription by requirement, we will have more troops to fight against our enemies."

TRM_Arm_Inf3:0 "Equipment Breakthrough"
TRM_Arm_Inf3_desc:0 "Recently, we successfully developed a brand new firearm for our soldiers. Although they are currently just prototypes, we can invest some money to produce them in proper numbers."

TRM_Arm_Mot:0 "Motorisation Effort"
TRM_Arm_Mot_desc:0 "As our army becomes larger by the day, we need more transport for our troops. New trucks ought to prove useful."

TRM_Arm_Arm:0 "Expand Dalzavod Facilities"
TRM_Arm_Arm_desc:0 "We can use our Dalzavod factory to produce a limited series of our own tanks. Tanks are invaluable in modern day warfare due their durability."

TRM_Air_Planes:0 "Subsidise the Aviation Sector"
TRM_Air_Planes_desc:0 "Our air force has been sub-par for many years. If we are to bring it back up to scratch, in order to compete with regional powers, we have to dedicate financial muscle to aviation research at any cost."

TRM_Air_Fighter:0 "Develop Transamur Fighters"
TRM_Air_Fighter_desc:0 "Fighters are main type of aircraft we should use. We can't dominate the skies without them."

TRM_Air_CAS:0 "Strengthen CAS Units"
TRM_Air_CAS_desc:0 "As we now have air superiority, we can now storm the ground with our CAS fighters. They are also valuable to us."

TRM_Air_Bomber:0 "Bombers of the East"
TRM_Air_Bomber_desc:0 "The skies are ours, our CAS is storming the ground, and we now can produce aircraft able to obliterate our enemies with high explosives."

TRM_Air_Doc:0 "Modernise Headquarters"
TRM_Air_Doc_desc:0 "Even with modern aircraft we have we still need a proper military staff to command them. We should intensively train some new officers"

TRM_Air_Para:0 "Vladivostok Paratroopers"
TRM_Air_Para_desc:0 "Airborne paratroopers are a new type of infantry. Not as numerous as standard infantry, these units can use aircraft to infiltrate enemy lines."

TRM_Air_Bases_Vlad:0 "Expand Vladivostok Air Base"
TRM_Air_Bases_Vlad_desc:0 "Our nation has been left behind by the aerial revolution. We do not have a single modern air field to our name. Since the Weltkrieg, aircraft have become a very deadly weapon of war, and as such we must possess them. Without air bases, even the biggest air force would be useless."

TRM_Air_Bases_Irk:0 "Irkutsk Strips"
TRM_Air_Bases_Irk_desc:0 "Siberia certainly has the room for new landing strips and air fields. We would be fools not to take advantage of this fact."

TRM_Air_Bases_Nov:0 "Develop Novosibirsk Air Fields"
TRM_Air_Bases_Nov_desc:0 "Our air force is desperately in need of new launching grounds. For this reason we should invest in Novosibirsk."

TRM_Crisis:0 "Anti-Kolchak Coup"
TRM_Crisis_desc:0 "Tensions in the Transamur regime are finally reaching fever pitch, and there is little doubt now that Kolchak's position is becoming increasingly untenable."

TRM_Kolchak:0 "Reinforce Kolchak's Authority"
TRM_Kolchak_desc:0 "Kolchak has managed to survive the coup and has defeated the rebellious generals. However, the spirit of uncertainty still lingers over Vladivostok. Only a strong leader is capable of pacifying the people and restoring order to Transamur."

TRM_Kolchak_Purge:0 "Purge the Army"
TRM_Kolchak_Purge_desc:0 "To avoid any further coups and rebellions the whole apparatus of military high command must be inspected. No doubt, there is still remain some opponents of Kolchak's government, who must be removed from their offices. However, these harsh measures will disrupt the capabilities of our army for some time."

TRM_Kolchak_Mil:0 "Vladivostok Arsenals"
TRM_Kolchak_Mil_desc:0 "The world is entering an era of global crisis and war unlike any seen in history, even including the Weltkrieg. This war will no doubt test our spirits, so we must be prepared. We must expand our facilities to produce even more equipment."

TRM_Kolchak_Doc:0 "Supreme Ruler"
TRM_Kolchak_Doc_desc:0 "Kolchak claims himself to be the "Supreme Ruler of Russia". For our leader to bolster his image, he needs a strong propaganda machine to help foster an effective cult of personality. Everyone should know about his glorious persona and great deeds. Kolchak must be seen as Father of the Nation in the eyes of his people."

TRM_Mil:0 "New Military Cabinet"
TRM_Mil_desc:0 "Kolchak is dead and a new dictatorship has risen. It will take some time to reorganise the government and legitimise the new dictator."

TRM_Mil_Doc:0 "Military Reforms"
TRM_Mil_Doc_desc:0 "Every dictatorship relies on its army, and as such it is crucial that immediate reforms must be implemented to improve military efficiency. Only the most loyal and effective armed forces will be able to preserve us."

TRM_Mil_Inf:0 "Buy Modern Equipment"
TRM_Mil_Inf_desc:0 "Our equipment is obsolete and so we must turn to the global market. Perhaps we will even be able to acquire blueprints so we can produce new equipment of our own."

TRM_Mil_ML_End:0 "Political Stabilisation"
TRM_Mil_ML_End_desc:0 "The situation has finally stabilised. Nobody can argue against our legitimacy, our borders are protected by a strong and modern army. People have learnt how to be modest and not to waste their money and efforts on nonsensical things. Order has finally returned to Transamur."

TRM_Yui_Focus:0 "The Japanese Lapdog"
TRM_Yui_Focus_desc:0 "The Japanese have never been welcomed in Transamur. The news that Transamur is to be directly administered by General Shigemoto has shocked many in Vladivostok and has caused great consternation amongst many fierce nationalists. It will take a long time and great effort to legitimise this new 'lapdog' regime in the eyes of the people."

TRM_Yui_Jap:0 "Begin Japanisation"
TRM_Yui_Jap_desc:0 "Now that our puppet regime stands on more solid ground, the time has come to take the first steps toward Japanisation of the whole region. A first wave of Japanese colonists has already arrived - made up of teachers, doctors and engineers; their qualifications will help us significantly."

TRM_Yui_Fac:0 "Invite Japanese Workers"
TRM_Yui_Fac_desc:0 "With the colonisation programme already under way, soon thousands of hungry poor Japanese will flee to our country in search of work. A cheap workforce and investment from the mainland means new facilities and new capabilities."

TRM_Yui_End:0 "Pro-Tokyo Propaganda"
TRM_Yui_End_desc:0 "Russian resistance to our cultural assimilation is even stronger than we anticipated. As such we should take measures prevent them speaking, listening and even thinking Russian. We should start a massive propaganda campaign to undermine what it is to be Russian, boost the people's love of Japan and finally assimilate them."

TRM_Rep:0 "Democracy Prevails"
TRM_Rep_desc:0 "We have finally achieved our freedom. No more dictators, no more mad militarists. It's time for true democracy to rise and wipe out the presence of autocrats."

TRM_Rep_Res:0 "Scientific Investment"
TRM_Rep_Res_desc:0 "The impact of science on today's world is undeniable and we should make good on this and invest some money into our nation's great minds. With the creation of proper work conditions for them, their efforts will be even more effective."

TRM_Rep_Fac:0 "Subsidise Industrial Expansion"
TRM_Rep_Fac_desc:0 "Further investment will allow us to expand our facilities and make our industry more productive. Many new workplaces can be created, which means more stable employment and security for the people."

TRM_Rep_Goods:0 "Build Up a Welfare State"
TRM_Rep_Goods_desc:0 "True democracy means that every citizen of our country deserves the best. By introducing a welfare system, we will gain many respects form our people. A happy population will work harder and demand less, which means more prosperity for all of us."

TRM_Pol_Research:0 "Major Education Reform"
TRM_Pol_Research_desc:0 "No matter if it is a dictatorship or a democracy, the aspects regarding education are clear in both cases. No men or women ever won a war, but science did. We must invest as much as possible to give our scientists everything they want."

TRM_Expand_RCW:0 "Lessons of the Amur Incident"
TRM_Expand_RCW_desc:0 "We'd been harshly beaten at Amur river back in 1935. This defeat could help us to learn about how to better deal with regular Russian troops."

TRM_FE_RUS:0 "Russia is Vulnerable"
TRM_FE_RUS_desc:0 "Russia is now in state of war. While they are busy in the West we can pressure them in the East. We must immediately purge them from our rightful lands."

TRM_FE_SOV:0 "The Reds are Vulnerable"
TRM_FE_SOV_desc:0 "The Reds have managed to win the civil war and now formally control the Russian Far East. But, in fact, they can barely control Petrograd. We must immediately purge them from our rightful lands."

TRM_Demand_Bai:0 "Push our Claims on the Baikal Region"
TRM_Demand_Bai_desc:0 "The Russian Far East is nothing but wasteland. If we want to expand even more, we need some industrial bases. The Baikal seems to be a good start for us."

TRM_Claim_West_Sib:0 "Go West"
TRM_Claim_West_Sib_desc:0 "The more our power grows the more our ambitions do too. Our goals are clear - we shall go West and liberate the whole of Siberia."

TRM_Claim_Russia:0 "Final Solution"
TRM_Claim_Russia_desc:0 "The time has come! Day by day we dream about the time when we will strike our enemies in Petrograd. We are no longer merely Transamur nor the Far Eastern Republic. No. Our claim to the mantle of Russian Republic will no longer be more pretence, but solid fact! We will liberate Mother Russia from the traitors that destroyed her."

TRM_Become_Russia:0 "A New Russia"
TRM_Become_Russia_desc:0 "The time of war has come to an end. Now is the time for a new, stronger Russia to arise. No more traitors, no more Bolsheviks, no more Japanese imperialists. We are Russia now!"

TRM_Invade_Turkestan:0 "Secure Turkestan"
TRM_Invade_Turkestan_desc:0 "Turkestan is not particularly wealthy or even populous. But soon enough, it will be ours, and it will serve excellently as a bridgehead to the wealthy Persian and Indian provinces, should we need it."

TRM_Attack_Caucasus:0 "Reclaim Caucasus"
TRM_Attack_Caucasus_desc:0 "The entire Russian state is under our command now. It is time to reclaim our soil in the Caucasus from the different insurgent states."
TRM_Demand_DKB:0 "The Question of the Don-Kuban Union"
TRM_Demand_DKB_desc:0 "The Don-Kuban region is as Russian as Russia, or so our military staff claims. They also claim that while the Cossacks who reside there are hard men, they aren't hard enough to fight from horse-back against our modern, unstoppable armies."
TRM_Invade_Azerbaijan:0 "The Baku Oil Fields"
TRM_Invade_Azerbaijan_desc:0 "For a long time, we have been reliant on expensive oil imports to keep our war-machine running. All in between us and a self-sufficient economy is the  small, weak, state of Azerbaijan."
TRM_Invade_Georgia:0 "The Georgian Question"
TRM_Invade_Georgia_desc:0 "While Georgia is not large, wealthy, or powerful at all, we must deal with them at once... It is a matter of principle. This is land stolen from us during the Weltkrieg. Soon it will be back in the fold, with the rest of them."
TRM_Invade_Armenia:0 "Status of Armenia"
TRM_Invade_Armenia_desc:0 "The Armenian people share our faith. Thus they should only be happy to return to our rule, No?"

TRM_Invade_WHR:0 "Invade White Russia"
TRM_Invade_WHR_desc:0 "The breakway state commonly called White Russia was claimed during the partitions of old, only to be taken by the Kaiser. We will not lose our lands this time!"

TRM_Invade_Ukraine_desc:0 "Powerful German armies had been protecting Ukraine from annexation since the October Revolution. However, now that we are back in power, our chance to reunite Ukraine with Russia is now."
TRM_End_Germany:0 "Time to End the Reich"
TRM_End_Germany_desc:0 "The losses at the peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk are too great to count. It's time we return Russia to the glory we held prior to the Weltkrieg!"
TRM_join_entente:0 "Join the Entente"
TRM_join_entente_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg we stood beside Great Britain and France against the Germanic Huns and their allies. Now that we are back in power they will surely be willing to help us, after all, Kolchak was a good friend of George V."
TRM_on_our_own:0 "On our Own"
TRM_on_our_own_desc:0 "Russia should not be a lapdog to any other nation. It's time we form our own alliance and no longer dance to the pipe of others!"

### Decisions ###
TRM_japanese_influence:0 "Japanese Presence in Vladivostok"
TRM_japanese_influence_desc:0 "Our government is not seen as a legitimate Russian state by the Russian people, this is made even more apparent through Tokyo's ever growing influence.

TRM_visit_from_japan:0 "A Visit From Our Masters"
TRM_visit_from_japan_desc:0 "In these harsh times we need strong allies to protect us. Japanese officials in Vladivostok have stated that they are willing to give us some support.

TRM_zaibatsus:0 "Open a Zaibatsu's Concession"

TRM_hold_vladivostok:0 "Hold Vladivostok from Japan"
TRM_hold_vladivostok_desc:0 "We have little chances to fight back Japanese troops down to the ocean. Our only solution to survive is to hold Vladivostok long enough to make the whole point of this war non-sense in minds of Japanese people. As Russian proverb says: "Elusive Joe is elusive because nobody wants to find him". We should become this Joe to Japanese."

TRM_raise_militia:0 "Raise Urban Militia in Vladivostok"
TRM_raise_militia_desc:0 "The time has come to fight for our freedom. Patriotic citizens of Vladivostok are forming militia groups to defend their homeland. With little help from us we can organise them into auxiliary units to fill up the lines."
