CAL_activate_the_Western_Defense_Command_desc:0 "Since we claim to be the real America, and our Army is officially the United States Army, the command hierarchy remains unclear on many levels. As such, we will push for the creation of the Western Defence Command, an apparent detachment of the Army which will work independently, and will reunite with the Army in structure once the civil war is won."
CAL_prepare_the_artillery:0 "Prepare the Artillery"
CAL_prepare_the_artillery_desc:0 "The indisputable winner of the Weltkrieg was Artillery. With it, our army may advance over a supressed enemy, as well as stop any enemy offensive dead in its tracks.

CAL_deWitt_in_Charge_desc:0 "Major General John Lesesne DeWitt, unlike many members of the staff who advocate for us to aggressively assault the enemy positions, has proposed for us to focus on more careful advances with powerful consolidations.

CAL_motorization:0 "Motorisation Program"
CAL_motorization_desc:0 "With the original rejection of the motorisation plans, a ghost has loomed the American Army as their methods became backwards as opposed to other militaries. Marshall has now proposed the government to subsidize truck production and to being the seizure of civilian trucks for the creation of motorized units capable of crossing the American countryside before our enemy can react."
CAL_tank_production:0 "Increase Tank Production"
CAL_tank_production_desc:0 "With the West Coast's low manpower, the High Command has had to design a plan to effectively improve what every man is worth in the field. In any of those plans, expanding Tank production in the West Coast comes as a priority, as their relatively low manpower cost and high combat effectiveness proves that it will not only save us lives, but also helps us push the enemy back more swiftly."
CAL_Officer_instruction:0 "Officer Instruction"
CAL_Officer_instruction_desc:0 "Marshall has presented this issue to our government, and his solution is to create forward study-bases, with more experienced officers mentoring younger ones in tactics.

CAL_recon_units:0 "Reconnaissance Units"
CAL_recon_units_desc:0 "Knowledge is Power, and Marshall believes that without the former two, victory in America will be impossible. We are outmanned and outgunned by our enemies, but if we know their every movement, then we can nullify our enemy's superiority by out-witting them."

CAL_defense_is_the_best_offense_desc:0 "The First step towards preparing for the coming storm will be to improve our defence construction.

CAL_Expand_the_Presidio_desc:0 "The Presidio of San Francisco has a long tradition of being vital for our nation's war efforts since America occupied it in 1846. As it stands, it is the most logical seat of power to direct our army's efforts, as well as the best prepared facility in the West Coast to hold the Command Staff. However, being the best prepared facility the region doesn't mean it's up to standard, and an expansion of the Fort is required."

CAL_bring_the_complex_west:0 "Rebuild the Military Industrial Complex"
CAL_bring_the_complex_west_desc:0 "With most of the Military Industrial Complex in the East, the Civil War has devastated the old munitions and weapons factories that made up America's war industry as they became high value targets for bombings and a preferred hiding spot of persistent enemy defenders. If we wish to be ready for the next war, investing into rebuilding the military industrial complex is one of our priorities."

War looms in the horizon, and only the brave men of America can protect her and our nation from tyranny."

As such, we should begin preparations for a smoother campaing through them."

CAL_wealth_taxation:0 "Wealth Taxation"
CAL_wealth_taxation_desc:0 "We can not allow America to become a new aristocracy whom impose their power through wealth instead of divine right.

CAL_public_works_desc:0 "We need to knock out two for the price of one and combat both the unemployment and under-development that poses a national security rise.

CAL_encourage_temperance:0 "Encourage Temperance"
CAL_encourage_temperance_desc:0 "Overconsumption of liquor is little more than a gateway to poverty, madness and sloth and it remains one of the great social ills of our times.

CAL_credit_unions:0 "Support Credit Unions"
CAL_credit_unions_desc:0 "It is time to shake off the overinfluence banks have over the lives of workers, farmers and the free-laborer.

CAL_national_health_insurance:0 "National Health Insurance"
CAL_national_health_insurance_desc:0 "When our citizens fall ill they are expected to pay for the right to live.

CAL_fair_house_trade_desc:0 "While trade has its place, especially for our farmers whom must export their goods, our workers can not be expected to compete with every nation on earth.

CAL_quota_act:0 "Quota Act"
CAL_quota_act_desc:0 "With all the pressure already laid on American culture and worker wages that last thing we need is large amounts of untrained, cheap laborers pouring over the border.

CAL_food_stamps:0 "Food Stamps"
CAL_food_stamps_desc:0 "Henry Wallace had a revelation when he saw surpluses of agricultural goods on one hill and starving citizens on another.

CAL_farm_credit_act:0 "Farm Bankruptcy Act"
CAL_farm_credit_act_desc:0 "The madness of allowing our farms to close, especially in a time of depression, is utterly intolerable!

CAL_birth_control:0 "The Pivot of Civilization"

CAL_japanese_support:0 "Japanese Support"

CAL_dianetics:0 "Excalibur"
CAL_dianetics_desc:0 "We can not simply return to failed faiths to save us. A manifesto written by Hubbard, Excalibur, takes New Thought to its logical conclusion in understanding the power of the mind over the body, an invigorting idea to Party members. It may take longer for the population to be won out but after training activists to spread the word of this potential power we shall usher in a new era."
CAL_shadow_recruitment:0 "Shadow Recruitment"
CAL_shadow_recruitment_desc:0 "The Party must continue to be semi-secretive in not only its total beliefs and inner structure but in its recruitment methods.

CAL_ufology:0 "Ufology"
CAL_ufology_desc:0 "With our rejection of traditional faith the question of a higher power is on the minds of many inner party members.

pacificstates.62.t:0 "The Immigration Debate"
pacificstates.62.d:0 "The situation the Federal Government arrived at when the Pacific States was created did not offer us time to clarify the policy of immigration. This meant that a deal being planned by the Department of Labor to allow for Mexican labor temporary work rights in the United States was frozen for a time. Now that elections have been held and Democrat power retained, we can now address this concern. This program proposed by the Department of Labor was meant to alleviate the west's employment shortage and was supported by the Republicans. Now traditionally our party line is to respect the Alien Exclusion act and the rights of natural born American workers to determine the direction of the economy, but our employment shortage is that much greater as we struggle to reclaim America. Perhaps we should allow this through?"

However, the glitz and glamor of Hollywood shady accounting practices that confound our ability to measure returns. Patriotic productions privately financed receive royalties out of gross sales, which have been very high. However, the deal we accepted was on profits, which appear to be next to nothing. This inconsistency needs to be renegotiated, and the studios be told that such creative accounting cannot fly with the American government!"

pacificstates.64.t:0 "Pacific Movement of the Eastern World Uncovered"
pacificstates.64.d:0 "We initially thought that our intelligence service was overreactive when they warned us of Japanese infiltration, but this revelation justifies the time spent. Our of our new West Coast operations, agents uncovered pamphlets sent to prominent Japanese and African American leaders questioning the validity of our government. These pamphlets were traced to an organisation called the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World, whose leadership appears to advocate in favour of a Pacific Japanese Alliance that advocates for unrestricted imperial growth of Japan in Asia. This organisation appears to target non-Chinese ethnic minorities with promises of greater social freedom. We have arrested the conspirators, but we were unable to tie them to the Japanese embassy surprisingly."

pacificstates.65.t:0 "Communalism and the Latter-Day Saints Church"
pacificstates.65.d:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-Day Saints, better known as Mormons, have expressed sentiments in recent months to strengthen the ideals of Communalism within the church in order to counter the sway of syndicalism. Notably the Church has come out with a faith-based welfare program, called coincidentally enough the Church Welfare Program, to help provide for support for fellow Mormons, furthermore the program calls for more Bishop Storehouses to be created. Due to the churches influence in the western states, this has also translated into increased support for the Progressive and Farmer-Labor Parties."

pacificstates.73.t:0 "Boulder Dam Completed"
pacificstates.73.d:0 "'This morning I came, I saw and I was conquered, as everyone would be who sees for the first time this great feat of mankind. Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.' Thus begins [CAL.GetLeader]'s Speech dedicating the creation of Boulder Dam that has finally been completed today."
pacificstates.73.a:0 "...and on behalf of the Nation to say to you, 'Well done.'"

pacificstates.74.t:0 "Railway Nationalisation"
pacificstates.74.d:0 "One of the Progressive Party's Policies it has sought for some time was a nationalisation of the countries Railroads. Now that they have power, the question is how exactly shall railway nationalisation go. Congress is debating between two different proposals for how this shall be implemented. The first proposal is that the railroads will be nationalized but not the cars allowing for private businesses to compete among themselves for customers, while the second plan would include the cars in the nationalisation. Which version shall Congress go with?"

### Flavor Events ###

pacificstates.101.t:0 "Perez v. Sharp"
pacificstates.101.d:0 "The case involving the marriage of Andrea Perez to Sylvester Davis has finally reached the Supreme Court. Andrea Perez is classified as White while Sylvester Davis is considered Negro as per the US Census. However, California's law forbids "All marriages of white persons with Negroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal and void" and that "no license may be issued authorizing the marriage of a white person with a Negro, mulatto, Mongolian or member of the Malay race". Consequently county clerk W. G. Sharp followed California Law and refused to give them their marriage licenses.\n\nHowever, Perez with the help of their lawyer, Daniel G. Marshall, brought forth a writ of Writ of Mandamus. Within the trial, one of the arguments that was brought up was the fact that both Perez and Davis were Catholic and wanted a Catholic Marriage that included mass. By denying them the license, they stated that the state was depriving them of the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony.\n\nHowever, the fate of their case is within the hands of the Supreme Court. What shall be decided?"
pacificstates.101.a:0 "4-3 the ban is overturned."
pacificstates.101.b:0 "3-4 the ban is kept."

pacificstates.102.t:0 "Sleepy Lagoon Murder"
pacificstates.102.d:0 "In Los Angles news has been made of José Gallardo Díaz, who was recently found murdered near a swimming hole in Commerce, near LA. However, what made the story more newsworthy was the case of the men who are accused of murdering the man. The LA Police found a gang of 17 Men, of Mexican-American descent, nearby and believe that they are responsible for the crime. This has attracted something of a media circus as activists have tried to protest the actions claiming that these men are not the killer and are innocent, the fact that there is insufficient evidence to link them. Despite this nine of them were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison, with the rest being imprisoned in Los Angeles County jail.\n\nThe case has generated much animosity within the white populace towards Mexican-Americans, not helped by the fact that both the Police and the Press have characterized all Mexican Youths as 'pachuco hoodlums and baby gangsters.'"
pacificstates.102.a:0 "Poor Diaz."

pacificstates.103.t:0 "Zoot Suit Riots"
pacificstates.103.d:0 "With the war going on, rations have been imposed upon the public. Despite this, some within the Mexican-American Community fount this by wearing Zoot Suits that use materials that are needed for the war effort. Many White Americans regard wearing the Zoot Suit as a sign of criminality and loose morals. Tensions have continued in Los Angeles to rise till they exploded into violence. Soldiers and Sailors beat and engaged in rioting against the Mexicans. Meanwhile, the local press tended to praise the Sailors and Soldiers of 'having a cleansing effect to rid Los Angeles of Miscreants and Hoodlums'. One journalist on the scene, Carey McWilliams, wrote:\n\n'Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theaters, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy'"
pacificstates.103.a:0 "This is not good."

pacificstates.104.t:0 "Zoot Suit Riots"
pacificstates.104.d:0 "In the city of Los Angeles in [From.GetNameDef], young Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have viciously been beaten. Their shops have been looted and more atrocities have been lumped upon them. The Gringo Press has even joined in on the action urging them to continue with their actions. To many within the Mexican Congress, this is an outrage. Our own citizens who have gone to America for temporary work, not to mention those with ties to Mexico due to ancestral are being mistreated. A letter to the [From.GetAdjective] State department will make sure that this is stopped."
pacificstates.104.a:0 "Lodge a Complaint with the State Department."

pacificstates.105.t:0 "The McGucken Committee"
pacificstates.105.d:0 "Following the Zoot Suit Riots, the Mexican government lodged a complaint with the United States State department. To calm tensions between America and Mexico, the McGucken Committee has been created lead by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, Joseph Thomas McGucken. The report concluded that Racism was clearly at the centre of the riots as well as stating 'an aggravating practice (of the media) to link the phrase zoot suit with the report of a crime.'

Some concessions and exhibits were unusual, such as the Gold Gulch, Lost Continent of Mu, Zoro Garden Nudist Colony, and the 'One Ton Mechanical Man.'. The Expo attracted 7,220,000 visitors during its 377 days of operation. Visitors brought US$37,700,000 to San Diego.

Many are considering it a ground-breaking film for its cinematography, music, and editing. It is a quasi-biographical movie about the fictional Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper editor. In the movie Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. However, despite all of this, William Randolph Hearst is furious at the film refusing for his papers to even publish the film and run defamatory attacks on those that did.

This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own physics research."

This unspoken contract between the people and their government has been violated by General Douglas MacArthur. In deposing the democratically-elected president in the name of 'preserving stability', he shattered the founding principles of our great nation. The destruction of the healthy civil-military relationship that has marked America since independence is a grievous slight to all the values we hold as a nation.\n\nIn response, the governors of California, Washington, and Oregon have issued a joint declaration condemning the General’s actions, and demanding his immediate withdrawal from Washington. We doubt he will respond positively, but like the patriots in 1776, we must take a stand against tyranny and oppression."

In it, he claimed that if the so-called 'protector' of American values could not even respect the basic rights outlined in the Constitution, referring to Douglas MacArthur, it would be up to the people of the Pacific to defend America's inalienable rights. Claiming that MacArthur’s overthrow of the government was illegitimate, a new election would be held to select a new president - albeit amongst a limited slate of candidates in the Pacific region. Still, according to Merriam, whoever won this election would still have more legitimacy than MacArthur, and would be tasked with overseeing the return of the nation to democracy - by force, if needs be."

Those naive aspirations were dashed when Governor Merriam ordered the National Guard to violently suppress a syndicalist protest which broke out in Sacramento. This escalated into widespread rioting across many Western cities, with Seattle in particular descending into violence. Longshoremen and teamsters broke into Seattle city hall, and proclaimed the city loyal to Reed’s workers republic in Chicago.

While some of the ships in Naval Base San Diego were transferred to the East Coast after the first signs of unrest, many remained - along with sailors from across the country. Details are sketchy, but it appears a base commander, on orders from Washington, ordered sailors to take weapons from the base armory and head into the city. Deploying themselves at polling places, they prevented poll workers from setting up. When morning came, large mobs surrounded these soldiers, and began pelting them with rocks, bottles, and other debris. One of the sailors, hit by a bottle, fired back, and soon the city descended into chaos.\n\nCalifornia National Guard units were deployed, and pitched street battles between sailors loyal to MacArthur and the Guardsmen erupted, turning the tranquil city into a war zone."

One of the newest parties is the Democratic-Republicans, the result of a unity ticket between liberal and reform minded Democrats and Republicans in both parties whom have tired of their conservative establishments. Another party to re-arise is the old Progressive Party, which has existed in various forms but has now absorbed largely progressive republicans alongside various social democrats. The most radical ticket on the left by far however is Upton Sinclair's Commonwealth party, functionally a more formal recreation of the EPIC ticket from 1932 and which promises a partially planned economy with regards to land and businesses that are believed to be 'idle', gaining support from both left democrats and the right-wing of the socialist party.

Meanwhile professional cowboy John Wayne, famous for his lead role in the hit Singing Daisies, has given an interview endorsing the Democratic Party although he also said he wan't particularly opposed to Hearst's ideas.

The accusations range from connections with the "radical" progressives formerly within the GOP, their initial push for conflicts with MacArthur and their legalizing of the syndicalist parties under Herbert Hoover./n/Howard Hughes was the first GOP associated industrial magnet to be called to answer for his part in lobbying officials to both continue the war effort and to buy his products while doing so. However the public questioning went haywire when Hughes turned aroudn the questions onto his inquisitor, Jack Tenney, by asking him if he had been helping Hearst corner the newspaper market despite Hearst now being a public official. Likewise he accused Hearst and his men such as Tenney and John Z. Anderson of engaging in lobbying efforts on behalf of the California-subsidary of the Bethel corporation to focus on ship-building contracts despite the war taking place on the same continent. It made it especially difficult to demonize Hughes as he readily admitted to lobbbying but said it was not only a common practice but that Tenney and Hearst were corrupt hypocrites and unlike them he never lobbied for a cause he didn't believe in."

Losses are heavy on both sides and we are losing public support rapidly, but while a tactic defeat in that we had to retreat to the Lost Hills we should expect success if we counter-attack, with our opponents having exhausted their best men. Nonetheless, this would incur even more losses and could leave us even less popular, with some of our cabinet preferring to retreat rather than cause more damage to California."

He announced that he would be sending out arrest warrents for those whom were proven to have connection to Britain, the coup and foreign syndicalism. While their allies within Congress and those most concerned about the coup supported the decision much of Congress remained silent to the decision before Homer Bone openly called him a "crackpot", causing chuckles and jeers from sectors of Congress.

We could simply round them up and put an end to it but our Japanese contacts would prefer if we simply warn them they have two days to flee for Canada, arguing that it would be much 'cleaner' and solve the problem of critics of the government without incurring as much protest. Perhaps we should consider?"

#PSA's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################
CAL_HENRY_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With the outbreak of the Civil War, 'Hap' found himself in the West Coast of America, where due to his constant disagreements with the national Chief of Air Corps of the Federal Government, he decided to join the Pacific Governors in their struggle, and provide any technical expertise he is able to in exchange for the promise of an independent air force."
CAL_DADDY_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps. With MacArthur's takeover of the government, Marshall refused to recognize his colleague as the army's generalissimo, and when the Pacific Governors declared their revolt, Marshall decided to join them, which earned him the promotion to Field Marshall. He is widely considered one of the most brilliant planners in America, and is one of the most experienced members of our staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
CAL_ALEXANDER_PATCH_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 23, 1889, in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Alexander McCarrell "Sandy" Patch, the son of the Cavalry Captain Alexander M. Patch, started his military career when he joined West Point in 1909. While a fan of the cavalry corp, he was quick to realize that cavalry would soon enough become obsolete in combat, so he chose to join the infantry, and graduated from West Point as a second lieutenant in 1913. His first assignment was the 18th Infantry Regiment based in Texas, from where he was assigned to Pershing's 'Punitive Expedition' to Mexico, where he earned his promotion to first lieutenant. Without any major engagements for the US, Patch reached the rank of Captain in 1919 and was posted at Fort Benning as an instructor for four years. He'd apply for the Staunton Military Academy in Virginia as a professor of military science and tactics, a role which he'll keep until very recently. In the meantime, he attended the Field Officer's Course in 1922 and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, where he graduated with distinction in 1925, and finally graduated from the U.S. Army War College in 1932 as a lieutenant colonel. Patch's remarkable service record impressed General George Marshall, who tried to keep close contact with Patch in the following years of his graduation. When the civil war break out, Marshall implored Patch to join his staff in the Pacific Army, a request that Patch accepted and for which he was promoted to Brigadier General."
CAL_LEWIS_BRERETON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 21, 1890, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Lewis Hyde Brereton began his military career in 1907, when he joined the Naval Academy with his brother and graduated in June 1911. However, before graduating he submitted a letter for resignation citing seasickness, which would make him unable to serve as a naval officer. His resignation was accepted, and he applied to be commissioned in the US Army and was appointed as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps on August 17, 1911. In September 1912, he undertook flight training in Rockwell Field, and would work temporarily on the air corp until he survived his second crash, after which he requested to be relieved from duty. He returned to the Coast Artillery Corps and in July 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and sent to the Philippines and would serve a year before returning to the US in March 1917, where he was assigned to duty in the Aviation Sector Headquarters in Washington D.C.. He'd go through a series of administrative posts and became a close assistant of Billy Mitchell in his attempts to make the air force independent. With Mitchell's resignation, his life took a downturn, as his wife left him, he suffered a crash and was found AWOL by accident while his mental health deteriorated greatly due to these developments. He was restored into service in August 1927 and was assigned to command of the 88th Observation Squadron at Post Field, Oklahoma, as well as an instructor at the Field Artillery School in Fort Sill. In 1931 he was posted in the Panama Canal Zone and received a promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1935 due to an excelling performance, which allowed him to salvage his reputation of his misfortunes in the late twenties. With the outbreak of the civil war becoming increasingly inevitable, he took a ship and arrived to San Diego right before hostilities began in order to meet his old acquaintance,'Hap' Arnold. Despite his inexperience in practical infantry combat, his excellent administrative and planning skills allowed him to become Brigadier General, by Arnold's own request."
CAL_ISAAC_WHITE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 6, 1901, in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Isaac Davis White graduated from Norwich University with a bachelor's degree in 1922 and would join the army in 1922, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in February 1923. He'd be promoted to First Lieutenant in 1927 after undergoing the Troop Officers' Course from the Cavalry school, where he became keenly interested in the prospect of mechanized warfare and the use of Tanks to break through enemy lines. He joined the Command and General Staff School in 1931, where he graduated as a Major in 1932 and became one of the army's strongest advocates for the use of tanks along with George S. Patton. As the country spiralled into civil war, Isaac sided with Marshall against MacArthur, leaving westwards from Fort Riley, where he was working as an instructor, and was awarded for his loyalty to Marshall with the rank of Brigadier General\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Very interested in the adoption of tanks and mechanized vehicles over infantry combat, but his ambitions may have to wait until the Civil War is over."

He was later assigned to the 15th Infantry Regiment in the Legation of Tianjin, where he learned to speak almost perfect Mandarin Chinese, and returned to the US to undergo a course in the Command and General Staff School, where his excellent grades made him eligible for an exchange program with the German Kriegsakademie, departing in early 1936. He never finished his courses however, as the Civil War began, and MacArthur took the reins of the government, Wedemeyer decided to travel back home and join the Pacific Forces, who he sees as the true American government. Upon his arrival on San Diego, George Marshall requested his promotion to Brigadier General, as his experience abroad could indeed prove invaluable for the struggling American Army."

He took several posts throughout the US and abroad, mostly following the steps of his father until his death in 1934. With his father's death, he was assigned to Seattle, where he had to put down several strikes in the name of the central government as the national situation deteriorated.
